<br />An Unconscious Intruder</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Docterr Ste-earling, Junyior,
Doct-terr Eth-err-ridge Ste-earling, Junyior.
Calling Doct-terr....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The loud speaker whined through laboratories,
permeated kitchens, rasped in corridors. In the
service corridor of Medicine Clinic the orderly rolling
the laundry bin halted to listen and expectorate.
Four floors above, Cub Sterling pulled in his long
stride and reached for a nurse&rsquo;s desk &rsquo;phone. His
voice pushed through the mouthpiece and almost
immediately severed the monotonous breathing of
the loud speaker. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Ethridge Sterling, Junior, is answering
from Ward D, Medicine Clinic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dead voice of the operator responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doc-terr Ste-earling, Jun...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s patience and his ear were closely allied.
He cocked his head and barked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice dropped several octaves. She cooed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>&ldquo;Justa minnit, Docterr Sterrling. Docterr Barton&rsquo;s
calling....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Barton&rsquo;s voice intervened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub? Harold Barton. Will you go over to
Weber&rsquo;s and telephone me at my home, please?
Right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later, Doctor Ethridge Sterling,
Junior, turned from an elevator on the first floor
of the Medicine Clinic of the Elijah Wilson Hospital,
gave a vacant nod to two internes and shambled
through the door, into the accident corridor and
out into Beeker Street.</p>
<p>In Weber&rsquo;s restaurant he folded himself into a
telephone booth and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Riverside 7863.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While waiting for the connection his long fingers
manipulated a cigarette. He was more excited than
he dared to admit.</p>
<p>What the hell could Dr. Barton, a life-long
friend of his father and Pediatrician-in-Chief of
the Elijah Wilson even before he was born, have
to say which was too confidential to transmit over a
hospital telephone?</p>
<p>The operator invaded his curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deposit a nickel. Five cents, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling&rsquo;s rangy legs began untwisting. He
begged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! Wait a minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Folding back the door of the booth he bellowed:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gimme some nickels, quick, Otto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto Weber had been bartender, confidant, and
advisor to the staff of the Elijah Wilson when Cub
Sterling was in short pants. He waddled from his
bar:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Cub!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The temporary Physician-in-Chief gave the bartender
a boyish grin and arrayed the nickels in front
of the telephone box. Then he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are two nickels, lady. If I talk up a dollar
don&rsquo;t you interrupt me. This is Wilson 7390. I&rsquo;ll
pay you after I&rsquo;m through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is against the rules....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots of things are! Thank you, mam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A slight giggle was her response and Dr. Barton&rsquo;s
voice drowned that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethridge Sterling, Junior?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harold Barton. I had to make sure. I&rsquo;m in a
terrible mess, son. I need your help! If I take time
to come over to the hospital ... it&rsquo;ll be too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his left little finger Cub gave the interior
of his ear a violent shake and transferred the receiver.
He moistened his lips, but Dr. Barton forestalled
his words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t interrupt me, Cub! Time is valuable! My
brother, the Attorney-General, is slated to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
elected senator next fall. The cards are stacked.
Today the Governor gave a political barbecue at
his camp. Half an hour ago, while returning, Herb
had an automobile accident ... out on Lincoln
Highway. No, he wasn&rsquo;t hurt. Much too drunk for
that! But the girl was. A newspaper reporter.
What? Couldn&rsquo;t tell you. Never saw her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another car of newspaper people came by.
They had an A. P. man along. Of course Herb
could &lsquo;hush&rsquo; it locally, but the A. P. man refused
to kill the story nationally unless Herb promised
to get the lady into the Elijah Wilson and foot all
bills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in an ambulance now. On the way. Internal
injuries. No, you miss the point! The man
insists her reputation as well as her ... organs
... must be intact. Will you take her under an
assumed name ... in case she dies? Say her
father is a friend of yours, and you recognized her.
Anything! If that won&rsquo;t do, think up another one.
Awfully unethical, I know! But I can&rsquo;t stand behind
any more relatives ... right now...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last sentence contained a note Cub had
never heard in Barton&rsquo;s speech. A helplessness....</p>
<p>Outside in Becker Street an ambulance screamed
up the long hill. Cub&rsquo;s cigarette was adding another
hole to the already scarred floor of the booth.</p>
<p>He said, and his voice had its steel under which
he buried real emotion:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Doctor Barton, I&rsquo;ll take her in. But
everything is occupied except a dying patient room
off Ward B. Will the Attorney-General pay for
frills? Private nurses ... so on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For anything, son! And Cub ... please ...
you know MacArthur and Herb admire each other.
If you don&rsquo;t mind...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clanging bell vibrated down Cub&rsquo;s free ear.
He snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between ourselves, Doctor. Suppose we leave
it that way? Hear an ambulance now! Report to
you later, sir. Not at all! &rsquo;By!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto Weber flicked his towel and shouted when
Dr. Ethridge Sterling, Junior, flung open the door
of the telephone booth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stoop, Cub! Stoop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the tall, angular body shot across Beeker
Street, Otto plodded into the booth, picked up
three nickels, stomped out the cigarette and replaced
the receiver upon the hook.</p>
<p>Across Beeker Street two firemen were lifting
the padded stretcher from a municipal ambulance.
One of them ceased pulling for a second and
changed his tobacco wad to the other side.</p>
<p>A big man bent over him and snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you get this accident out the Lincoln Highway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah ... looks like them dolls in the wax-works
down to Holiday Park.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Cub Sterling&rsquo;s left shoulder rose abruptly. His
voice ascended, too:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful. Take it easy ... easy ... these
steps are high!&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the stretcher was rolling into the Accident
corridor, Cub lurched into both accident
rooms, saw that the tables were occupied, and
turned to the internes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take her up to Medicine Clinic, myself. Internal
injuries. Just got a telephone message.
Father&rsquo;s a friend of mine in the East. &rsquo;Phone Miss
Kerr to prepare Room Two off Ward B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Halfway up the corridor to the Medicine Clinic
a student nurse and an orderly stepped briskly.
The orderly gripped the handle bar of a swishing
stretcher. Upon the stretcher, completely covered,
lay an inert figure.</p>
<p>Five feet behind, his shoulders stooped, his body
tense, slouched Dr. Ethridge Sterling, Junior.
Upon either side of him, like stubby pencils, a fireman
tiptoed. Cub bit his lips and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who called you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? When? For what?&rdquo; the one with the
cud growled.</p>
<p>Cub threw his hand forward, motioning.</p>
<p>The younger fireman answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fellow used to do fire chasing for <i>The Call</i>.
And say, Doc, he promised us a new stretcher, but
he didn&rsquo;t say when ... if it&rsquo;s the same to you...?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The student nurse and orderly pranced out of
sight. Cub Sterling moved toward the fireman and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s still yours! I&rsquo;m scared to move her more
than necessary. Send it down in the elevator as
soon as she&rsquo;s transferred. You wait at this door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Inside the door of Medicine Clinic, Miss Roenna
Kerr, head nurse, accosted Dr. Sterling. The pompadour
which overhung her long face was a blueing-water
white.</p>
<p>Beside her with the quiet diffidence of a poodle,
a fat interne was anchored. Miss Kerr said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Mattus, and Dr. Sarah James, the floor interne
on B are off this afternoon, Dr. Sterling, so
I brought the interne from A.... And am I correct
in understanding that you ordered this patient
into a dying patient room off Ward B?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Sterling&rsquo;s voice was crisp and ominous:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room Two. You are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Dr. Ethridge....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her bust began to inflate. His reply corroded
her vanity:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see you later, Miss Kerr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The student nurse, the orderly, the stretcher
swished aboard the elevator, Dr. Sterling and the
interne followed. Dr. Sterling, the professor, made
the interne forget the friction. He snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give you instructions after examination, Doctor.
One of the most interesting things in Internal
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
Medicine. Possible fractures, concussion, heart involvement
... anything....&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the stretcher passed through the ward on into
the room, the interne trembled behind. Dr. Sterling&rsquo;s
last sentence had been, &ldquo;Done many decompressions?&rdquo;
Gosh! Those older fellows hadn&rsquo;t performed
many ... yet.... Lucky! Had wanted
to go to the Thursday matinee himself, but Dr.
Mattus and Dr. James off.... Damn those
blood sugars on Ward A. What was a sugar content
compared to a decompression?</p>
<p>In the dying patient room off Ward B, a hospital
bed stood halfway between the outside window
and the door which opened onto the short corridor.
In the far corner of the oblong room was a stationary
washbowl with chromium fixtures. Over this
basin was a glass shelf. Upon the shelf was a stack
of paper towels. Two Windsor chairs, one straight,
one a rocker, and a bedside table completed the
equipment. The floor was covered with battleship
linoleum and highly polished.</p>
<p>In the Ward B wall was a glass inset through
which the dying patient bed was visible to a standing
nurse. On the room side of the inset was a
window shade, always lowered during examination.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling went over to the stationary basin
and turned back the cuffs of his white hospital coat.
Then he took a cake of soap and lathered his hands
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
thoroughly. The interne followed him and Cub
instructed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lather. Rinse. Lather. Dry. Best sterilization
in the world. After the examination wash it off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was silhouetted against the outside window.
His carriage and angularity portrayed his nerves.
His spreading fingers were tapering and full of
conscious strength; the joints were oiled with mental
precision. Occasionally his teeth measured the
outer rim of his controlled lips. His mind twitched
with his mouth muscles. Poor old Barton! He had
never understood his mild manners before. They
were a cover up....</p>
<p>The floor nurse interrupted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patient is ready, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling veered in time to see the interne,
thumbs together, rocking his hands to and fro
through space. Fat people irritated him. He
barked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit that foolishness, and take this history!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He strode to the bed and his left shoulder, which
he raised in the way some men do an eyebrow, began
rising.</p>
<p>The interne lifted an offended pencil. Sterling
was crazy as a bedbug ... but he knew his guts!</p>
<p>Then Cub&rsquo;s fingers automatically began the
manual examination and his mind revolved and
rushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beauty! ... A nose and mouth which balanced.
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
Hair as fine as a baby&rsquo;s and filled with sunshine.
Skin so transparent you could almost poke
your finger through it. The eyes should be ...
blue ... brown...? No! Something else....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted a lid gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, violet ... of course! Only violet eyes
could go with lips that curved that way....
She was too swell to be true...! Something must
ruin her ... the teeth, probably....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His fingers actually hesitated as he pulled back
the lips; then, as they relaxed again, he drew his
right forefinger down the cheek, as though examining
the jawbone. The motion was soft and utterly
gentle. It carried a sense of private approval....
The teeth were perfect....</p>
<p>To cover up this sudden finding of a live flesh
and blood perfect person, his dictation clipped and
became intricately anatomical.</p>
<p>During the chest examination he noted the nasty
bruises against the cup-like breasts, and decided
it was time to pull himself together. She probably
murdered the English language and slept with all
comers. The Attorney-General, for instance....</p>
<p>His irritation vibrated into her leg, when he felt
for torn tendons. The girl roused herself momentarily
and screamed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t give a damn what kind of general you
are! I&rsquo;ll slap your face again! Take y&rsquo; dirty hands
off me!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The interne had been called away over the loud
speaker; the floor nurse was busy at the ward telephone.
Cub Sterling tiptoed to the door and closed
it swiftly.</p>
<p>The tired wrinkles around his eyes began to
crinkle, a fine humor relaxed his brittle body. He
came back to the bed and squeezed the curly head
of the unconscious figure against his long leg.</p>
<p>Then he leaned over and whispered in the little
ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are all right, kiddo! But for God&rsquo;s sake,
wake up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went back to methodically examining
her legs and laughed shortly at the downy patches
where the calves curved behind the small ankles;
at the lopsided little V&rsquo;s in the big-toe nails....</p>
<p>Never before in all of his medical experience had
he had a devastating, unconscious, perfectly private
patient.... He lifted a foot and laid it from
the nape of his palm to the ends of his fingers. It
was half an inch short of his nail tips and the little
finger of his left hand could extend entirely under
the instep without touching flesh....</p>
<p>The girl groaned deeply and Dr. Ethridge Sterling,
Junior, intervened....</p>
<p>He took her pulse again. Noted the excellent
heart action. Began carefully going over the abdomen.
Once or twice she cried distantly, and he decided
the best thing to do was to put her out of
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
her pain. The heart action was so splendid that
the wisest way to keep her from babbling to the
nurses would be to narcoticize her.</p>
<p>So he took her head in his hands and went, painstakingly,
over the skull. There were no masses, no
abrasions, no visible signs of anything extraordinary.
She was in shock, of course. But an accident
coupled with an endeavor to make old Herb
Barton keep his distance.... That recollection
killed his critical faculty for an instant. He lifted
the head slightly forward and massaged the curls
which nestled in the hollow at the base of the skull.</p>
<p>The fat interne and Miss Kexter, the floor nurse,
returned simultaneously. Dr. Sterling resolutely
replaced the head among the pillows and said,
shortly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No signs of concussions, or injuries; with the
exception of that abdominal sensitivity. Case of
extreme shock. Acute pain is from strained ligaments
and bruises. Nurse, give her an eighth of
morphia injection. Doctor, keep your eye on her
respiration and notify me at ten. I&rsquo;ll be in my rooms,
probably. Main thing is to keep her quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse&rsquo;s flat voice replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Doctor. Do you wish a night nurse, Doctor
Sterling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends. Let you know later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blocked his exit. Her voice was embarrassed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They called from the Admitting Office, Doctor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
to complete her history. They said Miss Kerr
told them you knew her name. Miss Jaunts asked
me...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling swirled and glanced swiftly over
the face of the patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you. I&rsquo;ll call by the Admitting Office,
myself.&rdquo; Then he shot at the mouse-haired woman
a barrage of questions about the ward patients.</p>
<p>The interne gave the Sleeping Beauty a pouty
stare. There would be no decompression. By now
the blood sugars would have increased to six. They
must be done before supper, too!</p>
<p>The nurse followed Dr. Sterling onto the wards
and he began his rounds and gave his instructions.
At the patient in Bed 11 he stared carefully and
turning, snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that thyroid&rsquo;s basal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her response he walked over to the bed,
took the woman&rsquo;s pulse and said very absently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are doing splendidly. Keep it up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse followed him to the elevator and
begged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You <i>are going</i> by the Admitting Office, Doctor?
Will you return the blanks, or shall I keep them
until tomorrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scowled and his black eyebrows met. Then
he pushed the elevator button with precision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fill out the details, hair, eyes, that bunk, and
give them to me tomorrow. The Admitting Office
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
can wait ... for once.... I&rsquo;ll telephone over
the important particulars. &rsquo;Night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His &ldquo;&rsquo;Night!&rdquo; was another way of saying,
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all! And no more questions, madam!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator began ascending and the girl
operator asked timidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What floor, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling appraised her vacantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s voice quavered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Top floor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the elevator halted, he quickly raised his
head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, how&rsquo;s your cold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What cold, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a cold?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. Sterling. Thank you. I haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re welcome. Other operator, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped from the elevator and began his
rounds. A whole avalanche of nurses galloped down
the hall and he realized it must be time for the shift.
He squinted at his watch and saw that it was almost
seven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it to hell!&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Hot hash was bad enough. By now it would be
slime. Better finish the rounds and eat at Otto&rsquo;s.
Herbie&rsquo;s hands had messed things up! Damned old
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
spider! His memory was focusing upon the girl
when the floor interne hurried forward and began
to report.</p>
<p>One hour and a half later Dr. Ethridge Sterling,
Junior, tilted back in the swivel chair in his private
office. His left heel held the edge of the seat,
the telephone was balanced upon his left knee, the
receiver wedged between his left shoulder and ear.
His eyebrows were parted; he had just given his
pants a comforting jerk. His mouth twitched occasionally;
in his free hands he held a copy of &ldquo;The
Love Books of Ovid&rdquo; and his eyes measured a
familiar illustration. He decided that the legs
weren&rsquo;t up to hers. His father&rsquo;s voice centered his
attention, again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your thyroid, sir. Did a remarkable basal.
Pulse is down to 110. Lowest ... so far....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine! I&rsquo;ll operate tomorrow if you advise. Drop
around later and give her a final once-over. Be
there in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Father, I&rsquo;m hungry ... I missed....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. All right! You always were! Go get
your supper. I don&rsquo;t need you dancing attendance
on me! Still know an operative patient when I see
one. Don&rsquo;t interrupt me! You talk too much! Always
did! Goodnight, son!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His gruff affection blacked out the illustration.
Cub placed his right foot against the center drawer
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
of his desk and began wondering what he wanted
to eat. Shad roe? Lamb chops? Roast beef?</p>
<p>His telephone bell jangled sharply:</p>
<p>He propped open a recent copy of the <i>New
Yorker</i> and read four passable cartoons, turned
the page, then lifted the receiver.</p>
<p>Dr. Barton&rsquo;s voice begged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Yes, Dr. Barton. Been trying to get
you all evening, sir. Think she&rsquo;s all right. Pull
through. Can&rsquo;t tell for a certainty yet. Mostly
shock. What&rsquo;s that? Aw, she&rsquo;s average. Kinda tinselly.
By the way, better say none of those paper
people can see her for a week. No beaus and no
flowers. Righto! Not at all! See you tomorrow,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub replaced the receiver, rose, straightened
his tie, changed to a blue serge coat, tore three
wedding invitations on his desk to shreds, slung the
shreds into the waste basket, slammed the door and
slouched up the stairs, whistling.</p>
<p>The jingling of a telephone bell followed him.
That&rsquo;s why he whistled.</p>
<p>Five minutes later, the woman in the Admitting
Office wrote Thursday, May 12th for the fourth
time, and Sophie Merriweather, Newark, N. J.,
for the tenth time, and Cub Sterling barged into
Weber&rsquo;s deserted restaurant and said, pathetically:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otto, fill me up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Otto said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Cubbie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he lifted the hose of a talking tube and
ordered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three-minut-steak-two-vrench-vrys-asparaggus-on-toas-celler-y-
an&rsquo;- ollivs- VRIGH-TER-VAY!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slid the tube onto its hook, filled two steins
with Schlitz, blew the foam, carefully refilled them,
and with a &ldquo;from the heart&rdquo; motion, pushed them
across the counter and soothed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;tired, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub raised a stein and drained it.</p>
<p>Otto eased it away, refilled it and stood it beside
the full one. Then he lifted his belly onto a stool,
leaned his arms against the bar and said, earnestly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fut you need, son ... iss to get marriet....
Tonight you see you haf vent viddout your supper.
No vivfe allows dat.... No! Fut you need
iss....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub put down the empty stein and lifted the
third one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh hush, Otto.... I&rsquo;ll get married when I
want to!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bell tinkled in the kitchen, below. Otto disengaged
his stomach, threw back his head to balance
it, and before he turned, announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat&rsquo;s it! You <i>don&rsquo;t vant to</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Cub set down the stein and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do about it, Otto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little German drew himself slowly erect. His
words were carefully chosen:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub Steerlink, I <i>von&rsquo;t</i> stand-hit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub laughed again and begged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, Otto!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto turned his back and began lifting the food
off the dumbwaiter. His dignity surrounded him.</p>
<p>He placed the platters in front of the doctor,
re-filled the empty stein and announced placidly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are as fin as dried-herrink!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub cocked his head seriously and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you advise marriage, Doctor. Is that how
you got prolapsus of the stomach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With three quick &ldquo;Ach! Ach! Ach!&rdquo; Otto blew
himself to the far end of the bar and turned his
back. But he was careful to turn it so that he could
still see Cub&rsquo;s thick curly black hair and the way
he jerked his head. So the internes said he was
crazy! Otto rolled his own head, proudly....
You had to know Cub Sterling to understand him....
All the really famous doctors ... like Semmelweiss
... were queer. Dr. MacArthur, himself,
said that Cub Sterling had the flare...!</p>
<p>Cub slid off the stool and started for the door,
and Otto relented:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vus it satissfact&rsquo;ry, Docturr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub jerked his head and grinned:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Always is. Send me a bill soon, Otto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, Cubbie. Sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside, the sky was a pincushion of diamonds.
So reachable, and yet so distant. An unexplained
joy, that was ribbed with restlessness, pulled Cub&rsquo;s
feet away from the hospital. He began strolling
down Beeker Street. A silent, tuneless whistle
tickled his lips. The recesses of his brain squirmed
over the flat vacant center which was usually
crowded with sick people. The way he used to coast
this hill on a bicycle when he was in medical school!
Whew! Lucky there were so few automobiles, then,
or he&rsquo;d have busted up a sight more test tubes.</p>
<p>Lord, that was long ago! Ought to begin going to
debutante parties again, just to keep his foot in.
He turned the corner and made his way back into
Wilson Boulevard, and started the long climb to
the hospital.</p>
<p>A glittery night, no dying patients, a full
stomach! An interior champagne began to flow,
and then his eye caught, in front of him, the august
figure of his head nurse, Miss Kerr, sailing toward
the hospital. Walking carefully and firmly in the
glare of the street lamps; her tightly rolled umbrella
protecting her virginity.</p>
<p>His left shoulder began to rise. He stooped
quickly, picked a brick-bat out of a trash can and
slung it at the light just behind. The action was
involuntary and unpremeditated. It was an active
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
example of his inner abandon, and followed by all
the reflexes natural to a little boy.</p>
<p>He ducked into a shadow. He peered. His knees
trembled slightly.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr turned and scrutinized the street. The
search showed enraged dignity but bore no traces
of fear. After a fruitless survey, she carefully raised
the umbrella and proceeded toward the hospital.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later Dr. Ethridge Sterling, Junior,
strode through Ward B, Medicine Clinic. Beside
him the fat interne sweated profusely. He was
gasping:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morphia didn&rsquo;t hold. She&rsquo;s awake and
raising ... raising....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interne gave a relieved nod. The night nurse
rocked her heels in tune with theirs. Cub turned to
her and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand. I understand. Nurse, you go
back to your ward. Doctor, you may return to
Ward A. I&rsquo;ll tend to her myself....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interne hesitated and a fine hope glistened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Sterling ... are you ... is there
to be a decompression?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless absolutely necessary.&rdquo; Cub&rsquo;s voice
was very grave, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call you if I need assistance,
Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interne plodded helplessly off the ward. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
thought the student nurse&rsquo;s haughtiness was aimed
at him.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling entered Room Two, pulled down
the window shade of the glass inset opening onto
the ward, and snapped on the wall light over the
bed.</p>
<p>Then he gripped the bedside table and stared.
Among the pillows, eyes wide with amusement, a
wispy smile tracing the pale lips, was the head he
had held in his hands three hours ago, alive, alert,
intelligently vivid.</p>
<p>It was as though Cleopatra&rsquo;s understanding had
flowed into an Egyptian mask.</p>
<p>The lips moved slowly and she asked, in a monotone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? And where am I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the man who knows your father, and you
are in my hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The composure ran out of her face. She muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be funny, please. My father died in the
War.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling straightened a pillow, slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did. Now you go to sleep again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bitter wry smile began searing her lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think I&rsquo;m &lsquo;nuts&rsquo;, too. He did! He and
she both did! They were reporters on <i>The World</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub caught the pride of the inflection, turned
his back and adjusted the shade again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s voice was husky and amused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you give me a cigarette, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swung around:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not! You are too sick to smoke!
You&rsquo;ve just been in a horrible automobile accident.
You had a narrow squeak. Be quiet and behave
yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her pupils turned black with amusement.</p>
<p>She drawled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Used to having your way, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub blushed slowly, then announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of having your own way, the night
nurse and interne say....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a hell-raisin&rsquo;-huzzy, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bit his lip:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>have</i> you been doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes and voice dilated softly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just asking questions. I&rsquo;m a newspaper reporter,
you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub nodded grimly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl overlooked the sarcasm. She asked
levelly and with deference:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it much of an accident? Did I lose my
reputation or just a couple of teeth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub moved toward the foot of the bed and fenced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Publicly speaking, neither.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shot back, &ldquo;Privately speaking, the teeth
are permanent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>He stood at the end of the bed and looked at
her critically. She met the look and returned it.
A short laugh finished her estimate. She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it might be wise if we told each
other the truth? You snap like a police dog, but
your eyes are honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s legs collapsed under him. He sat upon
the bed. The girl continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bunged up am I? I&rsquo;ve got to get out of
here quickly, or I&rsquo;ll be fired....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s hands deprecated the statement. She
sneered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does a medical man know about life? Ever
been poor and discriminating?&rdquo; Then she threw the
gesture back at him and ordered, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
story?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swallowed twice and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in this hospital because your father is
supposed to be a medical man in a distant city,
Newark, New Jersey, to be exact, and a friend of
mine. You are recorded as the victim of a bus accident.
The bus went ahead with your luggage and
pocketbook. Your name is Sophie Merriweather.
As for your injuries, I&rsquo;m not certain myself ...
yet.&rdquo; His words were beginning to clip. &ldquo;Does
that satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shut her eyes and lay silent. A minute
later she opened them, cocked her head upon one
side and gazed critically down her chin, at her
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
body. Then she looked reprovingly at Cub Sterling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So-ph-ie. How could you? Sophie Merriweather,
Newark, New Jersey! I haven&rsquo;t got the
breastworks for a Sophie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The belligerence flew from Cub&rsquo;s face and his
eyes began to dance:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Breastworks, or no breastworks, madam, Sophie
you are and Sophie you remain until you are well
... or else a famous elderly medical man and I
get kicked in the pants....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without looking at him, she replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appeal to my finer feelings! I&rsquo;ll be Sophie
forever, Doctor, if you&rsquo;ll promise me that the Attorney-General
gets the kick and I get a cigarette,
immediately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s mouth and feet twitched. He rose and became
professional:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Miss Merriweather. The cigarette
is forbidden. Hospitals are pure places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rats! Ever look in the trash cans in a Nurses&rsquo;
Home?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, of course not, Sophie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lay silent a minute and wiggled her toes.
Then her voice grew small, and she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like you&rsquo;ve been very nice to me.
Darned nice! But you have to know sometime and
I guess you&rsquo;d better know now that I haven&rsquo;t any
money to pay you. I&rsquo;m really a waif.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>Her eyes blacked. She finished, &ldquo;Respectable
though ... very!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;re too loquacious! And you are pretty
sick. Shut up and go to sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How sick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you I&rsquo;d tell you tomorrow! As for your
bills, they are being taken care of, so don&rsquo;t worry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mouth drew to a line, she demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s paying them? The Attorney-General?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub evaded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were riding in his car when you were hurt,
weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally Ferguson sat erect and put one hand
quickly over her mouth. Sterling caught her by
the shoulders and forced her back among the pillows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was it? Where did it hurt you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here,&rdquo; she put her hand on her abdomen and
groaned.</p>
<p>Cub began examining her carefully and thoroughly.
When he stood up again he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, Sophie! We&rsquo;ll stop it if you want
us to. The bills and the pain, too. Talk about them
tomorrow. You must get some rest. Lie quiet. Be
still....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mouth fell into a fighting straightness. All
of the childish freshness which had charmed him
when he had first seen her was gone. She lay tense
and hard under his hands. Suddenly he knew she
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
was trying not to cry. Calmly he began talking
again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accidents knock a darned lot more out of you
than you ever suspect at the time, you know. You
see, Sophie, if you don&rsquo;t help me, then ... if you
get terribly sick and I have a consultation over you
... it&rsquo;ll mean sending for your father ... and
it&rsquo;ll be a hell of a mess all around....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her body relaxed under his grip. She smiled
again and gasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;May-I-please-have-a-drink-of-water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the glass was empty Cub eased her into
the pillows and she laughed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to hiss in your ear, Doctor, but
if I hadn&rsquo;t completed the sentence in one breath,
you&rsquo;d have yelped: &lsquo;NO!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Sterling ignored the remark and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that comfortable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Cub barked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to have better sense than to antagonize
your doctor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patient responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extremely comfortable, thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hair of the dog is good for his bite,&rdquo; and
before Cub could reply, she relaxed her eyes into
his and almost whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you ... for ... taking me ...
in.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>With a brusqueness he switched off the light and
bowed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pleasure&rsquo;s all mine! &rsquo;Night Sophie. When I
look in later, please be unconscious again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he was gone, she lay for five minutes convinced
that she had been dreaming, and then she
began to really dream....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<h2 id="c2">&raquo;II&laquo;
<br />Murder</h2>
<p>&ldquo;The hospital is facing a future
which cannot be prophesied. So far, we are running
no more than the usual deficit and our problem will
not be how to continue on our course, but rather
how to meet the increasing demands which, in such
a year, automatically become our lot. That, from
the administrative side, is the situation, gentlemen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, of course, a condition of which you are
too painfully aware; but I conclude the conference
with the mention of it, because it has been upon
the ability to cope with the desperate that the
reputation of the Elijah Wilson has been founded....&rdquo;
Dr. Henry MacArthur hesitated, his eye-glasses
carefully poised between his right thumb
and forefinger. &ldquo;Have any of you some special
problem you wish the staff to consider? ... If
not....&rdquo; His penetrating blue eyes and pointer
nose questioned. Men said he could sense a situation
in the hospital with the certainty of a dog.</p>
<p>The doctors around the long mahogany table
shifted in their chairs and prepared to rise, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Cub Sterling&rsquo;s voice checked them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have, Dr. MacArthur. A problem which I
should like very much....&rdquo; Cub began unwinding
his body and adjusting his bushy head, unconsciously
balancing that list in his left shoulder,
Dr. Hoffbein, Psychiatrist-in-Chief of the Elijah
Wilson, noted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter you told me about yesterday?&rdquo;
There was a note of patience in Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s
question. &ldquo;Why not wait until you are certain,
Ethridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. With your permission, I would
rather....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Words came out of his mouth as though shot
by mental force. They were chosen with a clarity,
spoken with a certainty and uttered with a velocity
which tired the ears of these men whose minds had
learned the defense of slow speech.</p>
<p>Dr. James Harrison raised his shaggy brown
eyebrows which had not turned gray with his fringe
of hair and his beard and reached for his watch.
Twenty years ago a smart-alec student had said
he looked like Christ in a Derby hat. But even that
didn&rsquo;t stick. A man whose hazel-brown eyes had
spent sixty-eight years laughing at life received
no permanent nicknames. After thirty years of
urology and literature, he still believed that the
wages of sin were occasionally a damn good living.</p>
<p>Cub moistened his lips and hunched forward.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>Dr. Harrison stroked his Vandyke beard and
measured the intensity of young Sterling&rsquo;s excitement.
Since Monday staff meetings usually lasted
from four to five and that was an hour when nobody
ever died, he could give the boy fifteen minutes.
After five, the really sick patients didn&rsquo;t wait
for an audience....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the best way to state the situation we
suspect is through the facts.&rdquo; The eyes of the other
seven members of the General Staff of the Elijah
Wilson Hospital turned to Dr. Ethridge Sterling,
Junior, temporarily Physician-in-Chief, aged
thirty-eight, whose present importance came about
through the premature death of Dr. Merritt at
fifty-two, and the natural advantage of being his
father&rsquo;s son.</p>
<p>Cub continued, &ldquo;Two patients in Medicine
Clinic, B Ward, have died of causes which seem to
our staff not natural in origin and which cannot
be traced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison snapped his watch shut and interrupted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethridge, isn&rsquo;t it possible you are taking your
Hippocratic oath too seriously, son...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Dr. Harrison!&rdquo; There was a note of
almost childish pleading in the man&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Dr.
MacArthur has gone over all of this too, and he
thinks it is....&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur took his hands from his graying
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
temples and stated: &ldquo;The deaths have occurred in
the same bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that phrase the waters parted, and Cub&rsquo;s
father, Dr. Ethridge Sterling, Senior, Dr. Harrison
and Dr. Barton braced themselves for the
nervous antagonism which was rising in Doctors
Peters, Paton and Hoffbein.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same bed?&rdquo; Doctors Peters and Hoffbein
inhaled the phrase as a patient does the ether.</p>
<p>Cub gave one of his quick, emphatic nods and
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first was a goitre I was preparing for
Father. Normal case with a good prognosis. Basal
average, and nerves in excellent shape, considering
the nature of the ailment. The patient died suddenly
and unexpectedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who attended her?&rdquo; cut in Flannel-feet Hoffbein,
as he was known to medical students, and Dr.
Otto Hoffbein, Psychiatrist, to the world.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling&rsquo;s internal barometer began to rise.
The antagonism between these two men was like
that between a mule and a shetland pony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Mattus, resident, saw her Thursday morning,
Father and I saw her between seven and nine
Thursday night and Dr. Sarah James saw her
about ten-thirty. She was dead by dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A grunt escaped the set lips of Dr. Harold Barton,
Pediatrician-in-Chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. James came to us from the Johns Hopkins
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
Medical School and is one of our best,&rdquo; Cub defended.</p>
<p>The men held their peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other death?&rdquo; Dr. Virginus Peters,
Ophthalmologist-in-Chief, asked, fingering his
Sons of Cincinnati rosette which in the private
opinion of the majority of the staff should have
been a dollar mark. His face was as open as a peach
blossom.</p>
<p>With a careful politeness Cub Sterling answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second was a heart case of a certain type.
Also a very good prognosis. Nothing to interfere
with an ultimate and complete recovery. She was
put in the bed the night after the goitre died. A
whole day was given to a complete and thorough
examination and the findings were as stated. Upon
the second night, Saturday, the nurse saw her at
twelve and at one. She died, suddenly, between then
and daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any autopsies?&rdquo; Dr. Peters&rsquo; face photographed
emotions as a stage does lighting effects. It now
held interest.</p>
<p>Cub stalled for self-control by lighting a cigarette.
MacArthur and Bear Sterling watched carefully.
When the cigarette was smoking Cub replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. Peters. Not on the first one. We
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
thought that was a &lsquo;fade-out.&rsquo; Upon the second
there was a thorough autopsy. Father did it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princeton Peters turned his lavender eyes upon
Dr. Ethridge Sterling, Senior.</p>
<p>The only man in the room who appeared to have
no interest in the question was Dr. Harrison. He
was scrutinizing the shadows of the afternoon sun
upon the tops of the trees outside.</p>
<p>Doctors Peters, Hoffbein, Barton, and Paton
sat, as much as their respective builds allowed,
upon the edges of their chairs, and looked at Bear
Sterling.</p>
<p>Bear Sterling resembled his famous nickname.
But as the years wore on, it should have been
changed to Polar-Bear. He riveted his decisive
steel-gray eyes into Peters and growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were no findings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence fell upon the table.</p>
<p>MacArthur, who had sat by judicially, started
to close the conference.</p>
<p>Prissy Paton, who had been an obstetrician and
gynecologist so long that the staff had grown to
consider him partly feminine, blocked MacArthur&rsquo;s
move with his high, soothing purr:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think is back of it, Ethridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t seem to find anything, physically, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison continued contemplating the
leaves. Dr. MacArthur realized the thing must be
seen through and settled back in his chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>Dr. Hoffbein, Psychiatrist, who was perfectly
aware that the staff didn&rsquo;t think so much of &ldquo;black
magic&rdquo;, therefore enunciated his words with an incisive
clarity and leaned forward:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your personal impression, Sterling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He inserted his sentences the way other men did
hypodermics.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling gave himself an angular brace and
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must be something other than natural causes,
Doctor. Everything has been checked. Everything!
Dr. MacArthur and I have combed the department.
The superintendent of nurses has checked the supervisor,
the head nurse, the graduate floor nurse,
and I&rsquo;ve gone over my internes thoroughly ...
man by man ... and woman by woman....
The reason I&rsquo;m bringing it before the staff is I&rsquo;m
stumped. Your experience ... then, too, medical
patients are often in the hospital six weeks to two
months. We can&rsquo;t have the thing repeated....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear psychosis,&rdquo; Hoffbein grunted.</p>
<p>Bear Sterling heaved his thick shoulders and
began fingering his key ring. Hoffbein and his foolishness!</p>
<p>This small oddly shaped brass key, and people
dying when you least expected, made him think of
the door to the cupola of the Administration Building:
the door nobody had ever entered since that
night so many years ago when he had fixed Flossie
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
Matthews for Ted Longstreet ... before he was
old enough to see why a reputable surgeon never
had any business....</p>
<p>Ted had held the chloroform rag, and after giving
her a transfusion of his own blood, had fainted
and fallen against his operating hand so that the
scalpel punctured her femoral artery ... and
Flossie hemorrhaged; and Ted lay in the pool of
blood. When he came to, she was dead ... of
chloroform. In the meantime he had tied the artery,
somehow....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone&rdquo; ... he could still hear Ted&rsquo;s voice and
see that hoggish splotch of blood his coat made
upon the white plaster wall as he leaned against it
and stretched his slim hands out toward the lids of
Flossie&rsquo;s staring blue eyes.</p>
<p>Murder! Murder! He&rsquo;d slipped in operations
since, but Ted Longstreet was the first man he ever
heard cry. That night, even now ... they were
all so young! She was a Tribly, Ted an interne,
and he....</p>
<p>Not all the honors in the world would ever make
him forget how they got the cadaver down the obscure
winding stairway behind the Director&rsquo;s office,
the Nursing office, the pharmacy, into the elevator
and down to the old cadaver vat.... Whew!</p>
<p>It was before they began ticketing stiffs and just
after they changed from the hook system and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
vat was a slimy mass of bodies, under which they
were pushing, sliding, hiding....</p>
<p>Then that vile job of cleaning up the cupola.
That blotch of blood Ted&rsquo;s back had left and which
wouldn&rsquo;t come off and Ted&rsquo;s saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sterling, every sunset the sky will reflect that
I&rsquo;ve broken my Oath and murdered....&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the next day Longstreet had committed
suicide.</p>
<p>He had never been back to that cupola! Nobody
had been there. The only key remained upon his
ring day and night. Since he was famous, he had
tried to believe that the blotch was faded, but there
came spells still where he&rsquo;d lose the key in his
dreams and hunt and hunt; when he couldn&rsquo;t make
himself enter the hospital by the main entrance;
when he would be unable to look at the cupola.</p>
<p>It took ten years of dissecting medical students
to finish Flossie; even then her legs were perfect
enough to carry over to the new pathology building.
They had a curve, even to the last ... an
irresistible curve....</p>
<p>Why couldn&rsquo;t he ever learn that he must not
look backward? If he had looked backward <i>then</i>, he
could never have married old Dr. Jemison&rsquo;s daughter
and been the proud father of Cub and honorary
this and that.</p>
<p>The only people who had ever known were dead.
Long dead....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>Dr. Sterling was cut back into the tense antagonism
which was rising between his son and Hoffbein,
when Hoffbein remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you no private conclusions, Ethridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no psychiatric examination, Hoffbein,&rdquo;
said Bear. Bear&rsquo;s eyes also knew the hypodermic
trick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son has told you the facts, and asked the
staff&rsquo;s aid. He suspects an unnatural situation in
his department, and asks, in relation to the hospital,
how our experience would lead us to handle it.
That&rsquo;s simple, and like all simple things, complex
enough, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison took his eyes from the leaves,
looked at his watch and rose. He had said nothing
for minutes. His action had the effect of a seine
upon minnows.</p>
<p>They were caught in his force. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is being done with the bed now, Ethridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is in use, sir. A patient of Father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then with the steady stroke of a masseur, he
went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing the staff collectively can contribute
which Ethridge and Dr. MacArthur have not
already covered. Mysteries in medicine are more
frequent than recoveries and Ethridge has my profound
respect for acknowledging himself up
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
against one. When one has toyed with homo sapiens
as long as Bear and I have, one realizes that they
are so damn full of mystery ... after all, people
will die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the most beautiful operations!&rdquo; Bear exploded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ugliest babies,&rdquo; Prissy Paton&rsquo;s life-long
impulse to fawn had tricked him again.</p>
<p>With his remark, the opposition collapsed.</p>
<p>The most respected and the weakest member of
the staff had declared themselves. There was
nothing more to be said.</p>
<p>With several passing pats upon Ethridge&rsquo;s
shoulders the meeting broke up.</p>
<p>Bear Sterling lowered his iceberg brows at the
utterly self-righteous bows with which Hoffbein
and Princeton Peters retired and growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on out to dinner, Mac, and I&rsquo;ll tell you
about the golf I shot yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Flannel-feet Hoffbein drew his half-expended
smile back into his facial muscles and slithered out
of the Administration Building and to the right
down the long corridor.</p>
<p>Princeton Peters pulled on his gray gloves and
sailed into the main lobby, past the statue of
Elijah Wilson, founder, through the front door of
the Administration Building and into his waiting
Packard. As the car slid down Wilson Boulevard
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
he turned his stately head and gave the Administration
Building a regretful stare. The architects
had been at variance about the period and the
structure screamed their different tastes. The four
corner turrets were the desire of Elijah Wilson&rsquo;s
engineering-brother. The cupola was the addition
of a New York consultant; and Princeton&rsquo;s educated-man&rsquo;s
knowledge of the arts was always upset
by the bastard byzantine building. If he had been
on hand forty years ago....</p>
<p>The car slid down hill and he folded his hands
sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Dr. Harold Barton squared his stocky body
which had never outgrown the reach of any child&rsquo;s
hand, and forged to the right down the corridor
behind, well behind, Hoffbein.</p>
<p>Prissy Paton stuck his smooth, pudgy and wonderfully
capable hands into his vest pockets, turned
down the long corridor to the left and in what his
students called his &ldquo;delivery walk,&rdquo; caught up with
the lengthy stretch of Cub Sterling&rsquo;s legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember, Ethridge, my boy, we are behind
you. We have every confidence in....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A group of internes passed and Prissy&rsquo;s green
eyes noted that Ethridge barely acknowledged
their greeting. Then that report about his never
speaking to anybody except with a nod was true.
Too bad! Too bad! He had been against his elevation
from the first. Too young! Told Peters and
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
Hoffbein so; tried to tell MacArthur, but the meeting
came the day, the very hour the Governor&rsquo;s
wife....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great confidence, Lad,&rdquo; he purred paternally
and pattered away.</p>
<p>Cub gave the door of Medicine Clinic a shove
and strode into the elevator.</p>
<p>Two minutes later he walked into Room Two,
off Ward B, and closed that door. The inclination
to be comforted, when harassed, was new to him.
He thought he was being medical and &ldquo;carrying
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally Ferguson turned over languidly and slit
her eyes slightly.</p>
<p>She was damned tired of being poked at by that
Jew resident and that hen medic; of figuring out
a career and a medical school for her famous father;
of taking cascara and mineral oil; of being a sport
and trying to like it.</p>
<p>Her long lashes raised. The slits widened.</p>
<p>Cub forgot his irritation and gazed helplessly.</p>
<p>Her lips began to part scornfully and she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well ... at last! Unchaperoned and alone!
Can I believe my own eyes? Give me a cigarette
while I regain my composure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Miss Merriweather. You are much better,
but you mustn&rsquo;t smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her back and lay utterly silent. Then
in a husky pleading voice she began:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you are too famous to be human!
I didn&rsquo;t know you were famous. I ought to though!
Famous, dictatorial, and snappish. So overbearing
flies won&rsquo;t even bite you! One of these pure-women-men.
No smoking allowed in His Presence!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub laughed spontaneously, and the girl flopped
over furiously.</p>
<p>The eyes blacked and the lashes began to wilt:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice had tears in it. Cub&rsquo;s amusement fell
through his lips:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sophie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat bolt up and every curl on her head
shook:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You devil! You....&rdquo; Her face changed desperately
and she fell backward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where? Where was it?&rdquo; Cub leaned over and
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my leg. My left leg....&rdquo; She sighed.</p>
<p>He threw back the sheet and began examining.
His brows had knit heavily. His mouth was inexpressive
and controlled.</p>
<p>The girl bit her lips, but when her eyes caught
his, she said, flatly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on. The truth. What is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s medical cloak lowered. He replied cheerfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a strain. These things crop up like bursting
blisters after accidents, Sophie.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Her voice was frighteningly quiet and shocked
him out of his shell. She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t do any good to lie to a person without
relatives. I report murder trials, you know ...
and I have a hellish imagination. No truth is as
bad as imagination!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s hand covered hers quickly. Their eyes
locked and his voice was calm and certain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may be nothing. It may be a touch of phlebitis.
In either event, I&rsquo;ll take no chances. That leg
is to be bound and remain bound for twenty-four
hours. And you are to lie absolutely still and leave
all of the worrying to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He gave the hand a squeeze and began sliding
too deeply into her eyes. He said banteringly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What brand do you smoke, Soph?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twinkles pleated around her nose, but her lips
were sober:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s phlebitis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub shook his head threateningly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear little question mark, won&rsquo;t you ever
relax?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twinkles burst through and she threw back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I did, I&rsquo;d be an exclamation point!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their laughter interlaced, and he switched the
conversation and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s Dr. Merriweather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Living with his second wife, still operating
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
every morning, writing textbooks in the afternoon....
No! he couldn&rsquo;t do that.... Those bitches
would have to know the titles....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub laughed uproariously:</p>
<p>The girl asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s your father?&rdquo; A fine radiance wakened
her features, and she continued, &ldquo;I like your
father. I heard him talk at the Medical Convention
Dinner last winter and I like him, tremendously.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub bowed quickly. Then, to cover his embarrassment,
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She twisted her head in the pillows and replied,
demurely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was sitting among the medical wives and
daughters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub laughed again, and the timbre of it made
her blush. She said quickly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Truth is, if you remember, Doctor, that dinner
took place the day after New Years. I was in the
Press box pinch-hitting for ... believe it or not
... the star reporter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer I didn&rsquo;t see you.&rdquo; The tone carried admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t very well. I was behind a curtain
trying to keep up with your father&rsquo;s mental ball-bearings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They roll,&rdquo; Cub said admiringly, then he asked,
slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name ... really...?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Her mouth twitched slightly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to medical records, Doctor, Sophie
Merriweather. But according to the church register,
Sally Ferguson. To the reporters on <i>The Call</i>,
&lsquo;Ferg&rsquo; ... to my father I ... was ... &lsquo;Salscie&rsquo;
... I like that best of all....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her body began to stiffen and Cub straightened
the cover over her legs. His voice was casual:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She <i>sounds</i> like a cigarette smoker. What&rsquo;s the
brand ... Miss Salscie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him slowly. Then she smiled.</p>
<p>And Cub said, &ldquo;Camels, Chesterfields, Old
Golds...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded and he repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old Golds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded again, and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to get you a pack at Otto&rsquo;s. Bring them
over later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice returned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Otto?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked to the door before he spoke and then
he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bartender who gave me my first belt, first
suspenders, first razor ... and my first drink!
May be late tonight before I get over there. After
eleven, probably. My house staff meets in ten minutes.
Then supper and after that ... rounds.
Be a good child, Salscie....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>Her eyes and mouth broke into a natural smile,
which followed him out of the door.</p>
<p class="tb">When his footsteps echoed out of hearing, Sally
Ferguson remembered that she hadn&rsquo;t asked him
any of the things she had intended to find out.</p>
<p class="tb">When Dr. Ethridge Sterling, Junior, again appeared
in the main corridor he had changed to
white hospital coat. The sun had left the trees in
the back garden of the great hospital and the
nurses were switching past in lines of five or six on
their way to supper in the new Nurses&rsquo; Home.</p>
<p>Had he put it to his staff in the proper way? It
was troublesome having women in a meeting. No
matter how hideous they were. They always listened
to what you said and divined what you didn&rsquo;t say,
and whatever else came of this thing he had to
stick by his staff. If for one half second they suspected....</p>
<p>And in a time like this why in the hell....
If love was as easy to diagnose as disease ... if
he could be perfectly sure! He had been married to
medicine for thirty-eight years and they had got
along pretty well.... Why not leave well enough
alone! He glanced up at the corridor clock and
swung &rsquo;round and returned to Medicine Clinic
again. This was no time to walk along reflecting
upon what a smile could mean. Better tell Miss
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
Kerr how things stood. If your head nurse got
down on you....</p>
<p>He lit a cigarette and considered. The proper
thing was to go to his own office and send for Miss
Kerr. But if he handled her with a touch of gallantry,
she was always easier.</p>
<p>As the corridor light threw his shadow across
the doorsill, Miss Kerr laid down her pen and carefully
smiled. Before she did either of these things
one was always aware that she knew whom her eyes
would appraise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Ethridge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She always called him that. When he was &ldquo;a
darling little boy,&rdquo; she had come from Massachusetts
General to &ldquo;help make the Elijah Wilson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub folded his frame into a chair and adjusted
it into angles of dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kerr, at the General Staff Meeting this
afternoon I reported the two unexplained deaths
on B Ward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dr. Ethridge! You ... you ...
wasn&rsquo;t it a little odd ... to ... er....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe so. Dr. MacArthur and I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you,&rdquo; she interrupted him and Cub felt
instinctively that the fire had reached the ridgepole,
&ldquo;you put the nursing service in a <i>very compromising</i>
position. A matter which reflects so
unfavorably upon the <i>whole</i> medical unit should, I
most emphatically feel, have been discussed with
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
the head of every department before being presented
to the General.&rdquo; A sanctimonious note entered
her heaves of indignation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He scratched his nose with such care that unless
Miss Kerr had been painfully aware he was contemplating
her large flat feet she would have noticed
it. He knew that the nurses since time immemorial
had called her &ldquo;Foots,&rdquo; and she knew he
knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Discussed. Yes. Grilled, perhaps better suits
what the nursing staff has been subjected to. But
before we were disgraced I do think....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as though you alone were bearing
the whole thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really ... er ... er,&rdquo; her pompadour and
bosom ascended, &ldquo;Dr. Merritt always....&rdquo; then
her china blue eyes protruded and she snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> speak as though you suspect my service,
Doctor. In all the years Dr. Merritt&rsquo;s staff....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suspect nobody, Miss Kerr. We do <i>expect</i>
the nursing service to co&ouml;perate and do as it is
ordered to by the medical. This is not a time for
disagreements. Wherever the blame, until that
blame is placed we are all culpable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur asked me before the meeting
if there were any special nurses on B Ward. Are
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>&ldquo;In what classes are the five student nurses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two in the class graduating in January, two
in the next year&rsquo;s class and one entered training
last fall. Really, Dr. Ethridge, hasn&rsquo;t my service
been probed far enough? For you, Dr. MacArthur,
the superintendent of nurses, and the head of the
training school, to suspect my staff....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub cut her short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We suspect nobody ... and everybody, Miss
Kerr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But woman roused without consent of will is always
woman who will not keep still.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to humiliate me before Dr. Paton ...
he&rsquo;s always been against me ... and dear Dr.
Hoffbein and even in front of Dr. Peters ...
without allowing me to utter one single word in
my defense....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Miss Kerr, will you never realize that
you haven&rsquo;t been, as you call it, &lsquo;humiliated&rsquo;? As
your line of duty in a crisis, your service ... like
ours ... is suspected of a failure ... somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and turned.</p>
<p>She towered from her chair with the determination
of a mule.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea! After all of these years! I can answer
now ... and later, Doctor, for <i>my</i> staff ...
and <i>myself</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>The last word came in two ascending notes of
inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you are correct, Miss Kerr. Good evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The water-off-a-duck&rsquo;s-back nonchalance with
which he quitted her office left Miss Roenna Kerr,
Class of &rsquo;90 M. G. and head nurse in Medicine
Clinic Elijah Wilson Hospital since 1900, with a
sensation of standing with her feet in a puddle.</p>
<p>As the elevator girl respectfully bore him to the
top floor where his early rounds began, Dr. Ethridge
Sterling, Junior, slouched with his tongue
in the corner of his mouth. He was thinking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could break her damn neck! Sex-repressed old
maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Miss Patricia Withers had been night superintendent
of nurses so many years that she had developed
an hourly routine.</p>
<p>From two to four-thirty, after all of the clinics
had checked-in their midnight patient rounds, she
read mystery stories.</p>
<p>After thirteen false clues and flukes, she had just
reached the place where the real murderer was to
be revealed when her telephone bell intervened.</p>
<p>With an intensity, every motion of which was
profane, she snatched up the receiver:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; upon a rising note.</p>
<p>The voice at the other end quaked:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>&ldquo;General Superintendent&rsquo;s office?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Withers checked her: &ldquo;Yes. What do you
want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Medicine Clinic, Ward B, Miss Evelina
Kerr, Student Nurse, speaking. The telephone of
the night supervisor Medicine Clinic does not answer,
so I am reporting to your office the death
of Alice Tuck, patient in Bed 11.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Miss Withers&rsquo; breath pushed each letter
through the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reporting the death....&rdquo; the student nurse&rsquo;s
voice began to quaver it out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you before, child! Are you sure? No
pulse? No respiration? Draw the curtains and
leave everything exactly ... exactly, you understand
until your superiors come....&rdquo;</p>
<p>There seemed to be no response and Miss Withers
feared the nurse had fainted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you hear me?&rdquo; the authority in her voice
would have revived the dead woman, if she had
been nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&rsquo;m,&rdquo; the girl breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do as I order.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">The night operator of the hospital was interrupted
in her regular reverie as to whether she
could get into the movies, by Miss Withers:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Dr. Mattus. Get the morgue. Get Dr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
Ethridge Sterling, Junior. Get Dr. Sarah James
... and get Miss Kerr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telephone girl decided that was enough for
the present and rang off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell-let-loose,&rdquo; she muttered and began ringing
Mattus&rsquo; &rsquo;phone.</p>
<p class="tb">Miss Withers sat drumming her desk. Again.
That&rsquo;s the third one! Superstitions! Like three on
a match!</p>
<p>Dr. Sidney Mattus turned over in his white iron
bed in his &ldquo;Germicidal Cell,&rdquo; and reached for the
ringing telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huzzies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spat the word with sleepy vehemence born of
unconscious fatigue. The contact between his ear
and the receiver took several motions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nayaa.&rdquo; The inflection bore no interest, it was
simply a sign that contact had been established.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Mattus?&rdquo; Miss Withers&rsquo; voice was like a
splash of cold water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he was bluntly and resentfully
awakening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Withers, speaking. The woman in Medicine,
Ward B, Bed 11, is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humh? Dead? Couldn&rsquo;t be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alice Tuck, Bed 11, Ward B....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mattus now wide awake thundered, &ldquo;Who says
so?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>&ldquo;The floor night student nurse has just reported
to me. That&rsquo;s the bed....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mattus, too, had realized that it was. He was
busily pulling on his pants. The receiver lay upon
the pillow and he was calling into the mouthpiece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get Cub Sterling. Notify Dr. MacArthur.
Keep the day staff off the floor until notified. Call
the morgue. Call.... My God, Miss Withers,
call everybody but the police! No you don&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t
call anybody but Sterling until I verify the nurse&rsquo;s
statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ran from the room, the telephone receiver
still upon the bed and the lights burning. He
started around the octagonal hall toward the stairway.
Three flights below ... in the center of the
lobby ... he could see the statue of Elijah Wilson.</p>
<p>As he reached the second floor he finished buttoning
his pants and started toward the door of
Dr. Sarah James, then remembered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spending the night with her mother in Cincinnati.
She would be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With an indignant grunt he had passed the
statue and was letting out his stride down the long
corridor.</p>
<p class="tb">As neither Dr. Cub Sterling nor Dr. Henry
MacArthur answered immediately, the operator
rang Miss Roenna Kerr.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Miss Kerr and Miss Withers were classmates at
Mass. General and it seemed only fair to tip
her....</p>
<p>The bedroom of Miss Roenna Kerr was bare as
an operating room. It was also a front line trench,
but the enemy in this case was age. Upon one chair
reposed a specially built corset to hide the collapsing
stomach. Under the bed stood, like a pair of
dachshunds, two large white shoes with built-in
bunion-rests. Under her chin nestled a wrinkle
strap and her hair was in &ldquo;papers.&rdquo; Kid papers,
too. She snored with heavy precision.</p>
<p>For the first time since the fire in Ward M she
was awakened by the insistent clamor of her telephone.
She arose, put on her wool wrapper, loosened
the chin strap, and walked over to the &rsquo;phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eeenie, the patient in Bed 11, Ward B, Medicine
Clinic, is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As quickly as the voice had come it had gone
and for the first time in all the years she had been
a nurse Miss Kerr stood inefficiently looking into
a silent telephone!</p>
<p>Then, in her highnecked nightgown, she assumed
her military bearing and muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whose son he is!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">As assistant to Dr. Merritt, Cub Sterling had
occupied a series of rooms on the second floor of the
Administration Building. Graduated to &ldquo;golden
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
oak,&rdquo; the internes called it. The furniture had belonged
to Elijah Wilson.</p>
<p>Sterling still used the rooms.</p>
<p>When his telephone began ringing, he lay caticornered
in his golden oak double bed with a pillow
nestled into his neck. He had reached that second
sleep where even an insistent telephone cannot cut
the purple mist.</p>
<p>But the night operator of the Elijah Wilson had
awakened Cub before. She began ringing in short
hysterical jerks like the throbs of a bad heart.</p>
<p>Cub awoke.</p>
<p>The pillow&mdash;when he became aware it was a pillow&mdash;flew
through a door and landed in the bath
tub.</p>
<p>He took his fury out upon the &rsquo;phone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Lo&rdquo;</p>
<p>The result was the same as if he had said &ldquo;Boo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Withers actually lost her speech.</p>
<p>Cub repeated the process and then in exasperation
rung off.</p>
<p>In the interim Dr. Mattus had cut in upon Miss
Withers&rsquo; line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Withers? Dr. Mattus. She&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stone! Get Dr. Sterling ... wherever he is
... get him ... quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub had decided, now he was awake, to smoke a
cigarette. The pillow was no go ... but that
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
lovely little laugh when he handed her the cigarettes....</p>
<p>The &rsquo;phone interrupted him.</p>
<p>He repeated his &ldquo;&rsquo;Lo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Sterling, Miss Withers,&rdquo; the words were
tumbling. &ldquo;Pupil nurse Medicine reported patient
in Bed 11, Ward B, dead four minutes ago. Dr.
Mattus has confirmed the....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cigarette followed the pillow ... but was
aimed at a different receptacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! You&rsquo;re wrong. I saw her at rounds.
About seven. Dead!&rdquo; His incredulity almost
Stopped his speech. &ldquo;Gimme Mattus!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Mattus is on Ward B....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. All right. Tell him to wait till I get
over there before ... and Miss Withers, call Dr.
MacArthur right away. It&rsquo;s....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had started to say murder ... but he hung
up instead....</p>
<p class="tb">The night operator snapped to the exchange:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now keep on ringing and let me know when
you get Riverside 7892, Dr. Henry MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, what&rsquo;s the trouble. Can&rsquo;t you wait....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Pal,&rdquo; the night operator responded.
&ldquo;You know as much as I do. A woman &lsquo;went out&rsquo;
and the whole place is raisin&rsquo; hell....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw girlie, quit y&rsquo;kiddin&rsquo;. What did they expect
her to do? That&rsquo;s a hospital, ain&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>In what the architects refer to as &ldquo;The Master&rsquo;s
chamber&rdquo; of a white colonial house replete with
early American antiques&mdash;mostly genuine pieces
inherited from his wife&rsquo;s mother&mdash;Dr. Henry MacArthur
snored peacefully. His wife was in Paris
and he had spent from ten to midnight propped up
in bed, smoking cigarettes and sipping whiskey
highballs. The enjoyment of sprees is based upon
comparison.</p>
<p>He lay with one arm against his head, the other
thrown out, from habit, toward his wife&rsquo;s side. He
snored with vehemence; he had had a grand
time....</p>
<p>Upon a bedside table lay a volume of Osler&rsquo;s
essays and several medical journals. They were
dusty. Only the telephone appeared to have been
used within the last week.</p>
<p>The telephone was as necessary to Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s
existence as his eye-glasses. To be so excellent
a director of so tremendous a hospital demanded
that at any moment of any hour he must
be immediately available and ready with a wise,
sane, judicial decision upon any subject under
the sun. Therefore wherever he went, whenever he
went, whyever he went could be known by any head
nurse who cared to inquire. That was why he had
enjoyed his spree.</p>
<p>It had been the servants&rsquo; night off.</p>
<p>It had been utterly private.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>He was topping it off with uninterrupted snores.</p>
<p>But the night telephone operator at the hospital
worked upon the principle that all men past thirty
snore. Therefore she took several surreptitious
puffs of a cigarette, cut in upon the exchange and
settled herself to the task of drowning out a snore
... long, continuous, vibrating, insistent, monotonous....</p>
<p>She was successful.</p>
<p>The monotony of the bell dripped through to
Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s consciousness. He turned over
and put the pillow over his head.</p>
<p>The operator took several more puffs and began
again ... this time in the angry insistence of a
crying baby.</p>
<p>MacArthur succumbed and reached feebly for
the receiver. It was no use. She rang like a wrong
number. But it was no use.</p>
<p>He was fully awake but kept his eyes shut, in an
endeavor to keep them from aching, which they
did anyhow ... terribly.</p>
<p>He fumbled the receiver off the hook.</p>
<p>His &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; was like a cow&rsquo;s &ldquo;moo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice which responded hit his brain with an
impact. He opened his eyes and listened:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Cub Sterling. The patient in Bed 11,
Ward B, is dead. Found by the night nurse fifteen
minutes ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Mattus and I have both examined her.
There are no signs of ... of anything. It.....
What shall we do, Dr. MacArthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remove the body to the autopsy room. Order
immediate autopsy. Keep entire staff intact. Notify
your father. Keep everything and everybody
composed and wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clearness in his head seemed to recede and
he crawled out of bed with a horrible weariness.</p>
<p>He had fought death, deceit, politics, criticism,
financial panics, women ... but this was his first
experience with ... murder!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<h2 id="c3">&raquo;III&laquo;
<br />Autopsy Findings</h2>
<p>Bear Sterling was tilted back
in the desk chair. The half-egg-shell ceiling light
blazed in his face. He wore the surgeons&rsquo; apron
in which he had performed the autopsy. His lower
jaw lay relaxed against the cushions of his chins.
His eyes were peacefully closed. He was asleep.
When the Elijah Wilson had been founded he had
been the youngest surgeon, and had learned to
sleep between crises. He did it automatically, naturally
and silently.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling had twined himself around an uncomfortable
office chair and was smoking cigarettes.
His left shoulder was hysterically high.</p>
<p>He watched his father&rsquo;s innocent repose with a
visible irritation. He had struck no matches for
over an hour. The smoking was incessant and the
old butt served to light the new cigarettes.</p>
<p>Dr. Sidney Mattus sat stiffly in a straight chair.
His head rested upon one corner of the back and
his feet tucked into one of the chair rungs. He
watched all of the men and held his eyes past them,
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
apparently upon the coming dawn which could just
be discerned through the high window.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry MacArthur sat across the double desk
from Bear Sterling. He had shielded his brow from
the glaring light and was soothing it like a man in
constant pain. Occasionally he lifted his free hand
and twisted his left ear thoughtfully.</p>
<p>No man had spoken for many minutes.</p>
<p>The air of the room was heavy with smoke, tension,
the odor of formaldehyde and the chilliness of
dawn.</p>
<p>It housed all the suppressed horror of a death
chamber, and its occupants had the appearance of
men awaiting execution.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s shoulders were hunched as
though prepared for a blow; even in Bear Sterling&rsquo;s
slumber there was a sense of watchful waiting.</p>
<p>Cub was thinking. Shall I keep my mouth shut
and watch that night student nurse...? She is a
niece of Miss Kerr ... remember that ... old
fellow!</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur raised his head as though to answer
and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did your father say about the heart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s eyes met his and he responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In normal condition, considering the history,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Strange. Was that your understanding, Mattus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silence lay over the air again. MacArthur put
his head back into his hands and began checking it
all over: Cub, Mattus, Bear, the student nurse, the
orderly, the Head Nurse in Medicine Clinic ...
the ... was there anybody else? Was it possible....</p>
<p>He stopped his mind and decided not to think
until he had some facts. There would be no sense in
clouding his faculties with hysterical superstitions.
A clear head was what must be maintained.</p>
<p>The morning light was beginning to fill the
room; it began to suffuse the faces of the four men.</p>
<p>MacArthur straightened and turned to Cub
Sterling and Mattus, and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry boys if I&rsquo;ve been taciturn ... but
the Elijah Wilson is my only child ... and as a
parent I guess I&rsquo;m hopeless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God, sir, we understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling was upon his feet and towering
over MacArthur. Mattus&rsquo; manner dropped from
him and he became almost a schoolboy in his shyness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course we do,&rdquo; he affirmed.</p>
<p>Bear Sterling stirred in his sleep and awoke.
His steel-gray eyes were softened by the coming
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
dawn. All three men turned to him. His eyes became
pin points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wish Heddis hadn&rsquo;t gone to that damn convention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve telegraphed for him. Could that sleeping
potion have been administered hypodermically?&rdquo;
MacArthur&rsquo;s voice was thin and old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Improbable. The order was for capsule,&rdquo; Cub
Sterling snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that puncture was from....&rdquo; Mattus&rsquo;
voice slid into the opening each man&rsquo;s brain had
already made.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Durn these pharmacologists!&rdquo; Bear announced
and closed his eyes.</p>
<p>MacArthur took his watch from his pocket and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boys, since all tests are being done upon those
organs, it may be hours yet. Go get some sleep and
prepare for today. You&rsquo;ll have a twenty-four hour
job ahead of you to sit on the suppressed hysteria
in Medicine Clinic ... and you have <i>got</i> to sit
on it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mattus and Cub Sterling rose. Patients, another
day, ... Tuesday! ... rounds, diagnoses
... they had forgotten it all! And within
three hours it must be faced again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>They turned toward the door and it was opened
in their faces by the second assistant chemist.</p>
<p>He was a small damp man whose limp black hair
sweated into his muddy forehead. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur, Dr. Heddis and Dr. Maids
are at the convention in Cincinnati, so I did the
tests upon the organs you sent over....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was matter-of-fact. Its uninterested
monotony awakened Bear Sterling.</p>
<p>He rivetted his eyes into the fellow and growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in the hell are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gentleman,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur said, &ldquo;who is
reporting upon some organs I sent over to the
chemical laboratory, Dr. Sterling. Dr. Heddis&rsquo;
second assistant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The chemist wiped his perspiring lip and continued
in the voice of a bell-hop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of the organs show traces of any foreign
substance except the ingredients of a sleeping potion,
which I believe was administered in powdered
form, capsule probably. I have not proceeded with
any obscure tests. Dr. Heddis will be back this
afternoon. I regret I can make no further report
until after a consultation with Dr. Heddis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bear Sterling&rsquo;s regular breathing was the only
noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Heddis is flying back. He should be here
within two hours. Sorry to have called you at such
an hour. Please keep on searching and consult Dr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
Heddis immediately he returns. In the meantime,
will you be so kind as to have a typed report of
your findings in my hands by nine this morning?
So kind of you!&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur stated.</p>
<p>He ushered the chemist through the door and
shut it after him. He turned to face the three men.
He stood so erect that his wife would have known
he had lost a battle and a tremendous one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bear Sterling, did that body show a hypodermic
puncture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that syringe contained something ...
I can&rsquo;t seem to make my brain ... understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">At nine-fifteen, Dr. Henry MacArthur sat in his
own office chair and peered intently at the innocuous
findings of the second assistant chemist and the
addenda which Dr. Heddis had written an hour before.</p>
<p>His long brow was pleated with straight thin
wrinkles.</p>
<p>He was reading Dr. Heddis&rsquo; supplement with
fascinated horror. It indicated, what he had feared,
that the patient in Bed 11, Ward B, Medicine
Clinic had not died of a sleeping potion. That
somewhere in the Elijah Wilson....</p>
<p>His door into the corridor of the Administration
Building was open. Except during meetings it was
always open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>His secretary appeared in it and said, &ldquo;Here is
your mail, Dr. MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone of her voice braced him.</p>
<p>He smiled as she advanced and laid the letters
upon the desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t dictate this morning, Miss Sadler.
There is an important staff meeting. Please call off
my appointment with the Woman&rsquo;s Board, and
that luncheon engagement with the man from the
Duke Foundation ... and ... take all telephone
messages unless they come from the staff, or
Dr. Heddis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the tall shadow of Cub
Sterling.</p>
<p>The secretary turned and passed out.</p>
<p>Cub took the proffered chair and said, &ldquo;Can
they all come, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. Your father is doing a brain
tumor on the Bishop&rsquo;s aunt, Paton is scheduled for
a hysterectomy on the president of the Woman&rsquo;s
College, Peters is demonstrating his new retina operation
before some visiting medical students; but
Hoffbein, Harrison, and Barton will be here, and
we have the others&rsquo; approval to go ahead. I&rsquo;m sorry
they can&rsquo;t come, but I do not feel I can assume the
responsibility of delaying the meeting. Is Mattus
coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. He&rsquo;s doing my teaching rounds with
the students.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>&ldquo;Heddis believes....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur slid the typewritten findings
toward Cub. The young man lit a cigarette, looked
away from them and frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur,&rdquo; his voice had assumed its
steely quality under which he always hid his emotions.
He held out an envelope.</p>
<p>MacArthur took it automatically and asked,
&ldquo;What is it, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My resignation, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur straightened as though he had been
struck by an electric eel. His blue eyes shot into
Cub Sterling&rsquo;s and he muttered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid to face the music, Ethridge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do it without hysterics,&rdquo; MacArthur
ordered, tearing the envelope into shreds as Prissy
Paton&rsquo;s purring voice interrupted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, am I the first one here, MacArthur?
Good morning, Ethridge. Pleasant morning. Cancerous
through and through. No use removing anything.
Fine woman, and great influence in her
generation. Sewed her up again. No use. Will
probably live several months. Are the rumors I hear
true? Has there been another? I thought it was
that yesterday. I said to myself, &lsquo;it certainly has
all the symptoms....&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blow your bubbles out of the window, Boy
Blue,&rdquo; Dr. Harrison chuckled easing Dr. Paton
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
into a chair. Then he walked over and shook hands
with Ethridge Sterling, Junior, and with Dr. MacArthur.</p>
<p>He seated himself, took out his pipe and began
talking of the tremendous discoveries of the ruins
of Roman towns which had recently been ascertained
in England by means of the airplane.</p>
<p>He filled the room with sanity. Dr. Paton went
to his usual morning manicure, and Dr. Barton
came in quietly, nodded, sat down and joined the
listening group. Nobody noticed Flannel-feet
Hoffbein&rsquo;s entrance.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison stopped and turned politely to
Dr. MacArthur; like obedient schoolboys the other
four men turned to MacArthur also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I know it is most unusual and inconvenient
to be called to a staff meeting without
notice and at this hour. Still I believe the occasion
justifies the summons. The thing of which Ethridge
told you yesterday afternoon, is this morning....
At three <span class="sc">A.M.</span> the patient in Bed 11,
Ward B, Medicine Clinic was found ... dead.
There was an unexplained puncture from a hypodermic
syringe in the left arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;MacArthur,&rdquo; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s voice had become
an august bass, &ldquo;are you s-u-r-e?&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur stood up and walked toward Dr.
Harrison. In his extended hand was the typewritten
sheet. He was even straighter than he had been
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
in the autopsy room. For thirty-odd years his and
Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s great passion had been the Elijah
Wilson Hospital. Harrison rose. They met in a
patch of morning sunshine, which threw the sheen
from Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s head into a mirror over the
mantel and back into Prissy Paton&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>Prissy gave a hysterical gasp and prepared to
scream. Dr. Barton, in the voice he used with children,
remarked, &ldquo;Easy, sister. Easy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nobody laughed.</p>
<p>Nobody registered it.</p>
<p>Hoffbein breathed like a returning pearl diver
and enunciated carefully, &ldquo;Read it, Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Dr. MacArthur returned to his chair and
Dr. Harrison cleared his throat, the door into the
corridor opened slightly and Princeton Peters&rsquo;
peach-blossom face vied with the morning sun. Cub
Sterling saw it and winced. Before any other man
had taken it in, Princeton tiptoed into the room
and his lavender eyes had assumed their death-mask
purple.</p>
<p>With a precision which carried the force of bass
waves against a rock ledge, Harrison began engraving
into his brain and into theirs, the report of
the second assistant chemist. As he turned the page
to Dr. Heddis&rsquo; supplement, the men stirred nervously
and Hoffbein&rsquo;s eyes took on a mountain-out-of-molehill
scorn.</p>
<p>Dr. Heddis&rsquo; addition stated: &ldquo;The routine tests,
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
afore referred to, are being checked by my first
assistant, Dr. Maids, who returned with me; so far
they reveal nothing other than the ingredients of
a sleeping potion. These ingredients tally with
those prescribed in the order filed upon the patient&rsquo;s
chart. Toxicology, like other branches of the Profession,
is partly guess work. Since the cadaver
bears evidence of a hypodermic puncture, and indications
are that the potion was not administered
that way, my belief is that this patient died of a
syringe of some obscure drug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore I am immediately beginning upon
the obscure tests. It may take days to prove or disprove
my conclusions. In the meantime, I repeat, a
sleeping potion prescribed in capsule form, which
the pharmacy compounded and the student nurse
states she administered, explains neither the syringe
puncture nor the death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indications, it seems to me, point to an obscure
and deadly drug. Possibly a drug which may be
administered <i>per os</i>, and may have been so administered
in the two previous cases. Any findings will
be immediately reported to the General Staff or
Dr. MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the last words scraped into the consciousness
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
of the men, a solemnity comparable to that which
shadows the faces of pallbearers as they watch the
coffin of a beloved comrade lowered, blanketed the
staff. Whatever their petty hates and puerile quarrels,
so far as the reputation of the Elijah Wilson
was concerned, they agreed. It must not be damaged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He might be wrong,&rdquo; Prissy quavered.</p>
<p>Nobody heard him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An obscure and deadly drug. Poison. And it
may take days to discover it. Something we never
heard of, probably.&rdquo; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s voice seemed
to be directed toward his own mind.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s wait for Heddis on the chemistry, gentlemen.
Ethridge and Mattus have spent the last two
hours searching texts. They could find nothing.
We would only waste time surmising.&rdquo; Then, as
though Prissy&rsquo;s statement had just reached his
brain he turned to him and said, &ldquo;Yes, he might be
wrong. But we can&rsquo;t have this thing continue, and
until he is proved wrong....&rdquo; He shook his head
slowly, &ldquo;The effect was obvious. The woman is
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a full minute after Dr. MacArthur ceased
speaking, no man spoke, and it was Prissy&rsquo;s high
treble which cut into their consciences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethridge ... er ... how was she last
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her around seven,&rdquo; his voice took on its
protective clip. &ldquo;Her pulse was around a hundred.
Considering her condition that was not odd. Her
spirits were excellent. Eager for Father to go ahead
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
with the operation. He saw her between eight and
nine. Found condition quite in line with the way
she was when I saw her. Is that your understanding,
Dr. MacArthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ... er ... by the way, where is your
father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is doing a brain tumor, Dr. Paton,&rdquo; Dr.
MacArthur cut in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how did your resident ... Doctor ...
er?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mattus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes ... thank you ... Dr. Mattus, consider
her?&rdquo; Hoffbein slid his question into Cub.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw her before she went to sleep around
nine. He reports her pulse had dropped to around
ninety; otherwise her condition remained unchanged.
Anything else, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoffbein never answered verbally questions
which did not flatter him. He shook his head
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>By that time the staff had regained some measure
of its equilibrium and Dr. MacArthur continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between the time Mattus saw her and three
<span class="sc">A.M.</span> she was ... was....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in favor of turning the whole thing over to
the police,&rdquo; Princeton Peters said most righteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not!&rdquo; Dr. Harrison was vehement. &ldquo;Outside
of this room ... with the exception of Bear
Sterling and Heddis ... no living person is
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
aware of the situation,&rdquo; he pointed the paper at
Peters&rsquo; face. &ldquo;Some linen is too foul to wash in
public. Want to ruin the hospital, d&rsquo;ye? We think
we are pretty good at death and birth ... and
we shall not be downed by....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He waved the paper at them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Dr. MacArthur realized he had expressed
an opinion himself....</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your conclusion, gentlemen?&rdquo; he hurried
to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mistake to form one without an examination of
the witnesses, I think ... if you can call them
that ... suh,&rdquo; Dr. Barton interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite. Ethridge and I decided upon that during
the autopsy. And I have arranged with my secretary
to call them quietly ... and separately ...
in order to avoid.... We would have questioned
them minutely this morning; but the seriousness of
our decision ... whatever it is ... must be a
responsibility we <i>all</i> bear. D&rsquo;y&rsquo;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The night student nurse on Ward B is waiting.
Shall I have her brought in, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoffbein sensed a suppressed motion of Cub
Sterling&rsquo;s, a slight movement in the chair, an intangible
gathering of forces.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this rather cruel?&rdquo; Dr. Harrison suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terribly. But how else will we ever...?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Princeton Peters interrupted Dr. MacArthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder is cruel, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first time the word had been mentioned.
It rushed into the faces of the seven men
like an angry wind.</p>
<p>During the ensuing vacuum, Dr. MacArthur
lifted his telephone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Sadler, will you please bring that pupil
nurse to my office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl entered tensely.</p>
<p>Dr. Barton noticed her eyes were blue and too
closely set; Prissy thought the face was sweet;
Princeton Peters felt she had been nicely brought
up; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s brain flashed &ldquo;kitten lined with
ox-hide&rdquo;; Cub noticed her feet were flat, and Dr.
MacArthur was too benevolent for a personal estimate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you sit down, Miss ... er....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Evelina Kerr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice held a note of defiance as she took the
proffered chair beside Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; he said soothingly, &ldquo;this is probably
the most trying duty you have had in your whole
training ... and we regret that it is unavoidable.
Will you please tell us plainly ... and as minutely
as you can remember, exactly what happened
after you went on duty in B Ward last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sat with her feet together, her hands folded
in her lap, and a sullen calm in her voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock, Dr. MacArthur, I went on
night duty on B Ward of Medicine Clinic. Aunt
Roenna ... I mean Miss Kerr ... was on the
floor and Miss Kexter, the white nurse, who had
waited to give me my instructions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;White nurse?&rdquo; Princeton Peters&rsquo; voice was
polite, but demanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slang for graduate floor nurse in charge,&rdquo; Cub
Sterling supplied.</p>
<p>The student nurse was silent in her resentment.
Finally she continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They left together. Then I took my temperatures,
counted pulses, prepared the patients for the
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patient in Bed 11, Miss Kerr,&rdquo; Hoffbein
began in his mesmerizing voice. &ldquo;How was she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl started and turned toward him with the
underlying resentment of a schoolboy stopped
midway through the multiplication tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was all right, Dr. Hoffbein. She had no
temperature and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her pulse?&rdquo; he interrupted again.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling stirred restlessly and lit a cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was between ninety and a hundred. By nine-thirty
I had given all of my medicines....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did she have any medicine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. Hoffbein, she did. She had a prescription
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
of Dr. Sterling, Senior&rsquo;s. A ... a sleeping
potion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what it was?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. It came up from the pharmacy filled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t the duplicate on her chart?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was pheno-barbital,&rdquo; Cub Sterling cut in
raspingly.</p>
<p>The girl hesitated. She seemed to have lost the
thread of her thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead with the story, child,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur
soothed.</p>
<p>She sat silent a moment and then continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;By ten o&rsquo;clock I had finished my medicines,
temperatures and pulses. The ward was quiet and
I started to work upon the fever charts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orderly was in the kitchen straightening
up and fixing the breakfast trays. Two patients
called for bed-pans. The orderly came to tell me
that we were short two milk bottles. I telephoned
the kitchens about them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otherwise the ward was perfectly quiet, except
for an occasional cough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At ten-fifteen, Miss Willis, the night supervisor
in Medicine, made her rounds, and told me
to watch the patient in Bed 11 very carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At eleven-forty I went to the medicine closet
to prepare the hypodermic Dr. Mattus had ordered
for another patient.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of hypodermic?&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur
inserted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strophanthin mixture. She&rsquo;s a cardiac case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dispensary case of cardiac insufficiency,&rdquo;
Cub Sterling cut in.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr&rsquo;s resentment was again expressed by
silence. She seemed to be debating with herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What happened?&rdquo; Hoffbein demanded curtly.</p>
<p>For the first time since she had come into the
room her speech came spontaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... I ... was boiling the syringe and had
my back to the corridor door, and suddenly I felt
someone passing in the corridor and turned around,
and ran to the medicine closet door. There was no
one in sight. And then I remembered the boiling
syringe and went back to turn it off. I couldn&rsquo;t
leave until I had. It would have been ruined, and if
the patient didn&rsquo;t get her dose in time she might
die.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I made myself finish filling the syringe and
then went into the ward. There was nobody there,
and all of the patients were sleeping, except Mrs.
Witherspoon, who is queer in the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked her if she had seen anybody and she
said, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s speech died in her throat and the
seven men held their breath.</p>
<p>MacArthur regained his first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom did she say she saw, Miss Kerr?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>&ldquo;She said she saw Dr. ... Dr. ... Sterling
... Junior....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned her close-set eyes, acid with hate,
upon Cub Sterling. Princeton&rsquo;s lavender eyes,
death-purple, Prissy&rsquo;s green ones glinting, Hoffbein&rsquo;s
black ones deep as wells and the brown eyes
of Doctors Barton and Harrison, gravely inquiring,
turned upon Cub Sterling.</p>
<p>Only Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s eyes remained the same.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling answered the inquiry sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patient is deranged, gentlemen. I was in
my rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened and Bear Sterling, his brows
beetling, entered. Cub rose and gave him his seat.
Dr. Harrison pulled up a vacant chair and motioned
Cub into it. The chair was between his and
Dr. Barton&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Prissy Paton looked at Princeton Peters and
both of them decided they had better not speak
... now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what happened next, Miss Kerr?&rdquo; Hoffbein
insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went and asked the orderly if he had seen
anybody and he said &lsquo;No.&rsquo; So I went and looked at
the patient in Bed 11 again. She was sleeping
peacefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison leaned suddenly forward. His voice
was acid:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did that deranged patient see anybody else?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his voice stabbed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The close eyes shifted quickly. Her response
came instantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Doctor Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silence began stretching. The girl continued
abruptly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I went back to my desk and finished my
fever charts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not call your supervisor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. MacArthur. I finished the fever charts
and then made the midnight rounds. The patient
in Bed 11 was still sleeping peacefully. I called in
the rounds to my night supervisor and began
studying my nursing manual. Three patients rang
their bells between then and two. One wanted a
glass of water and two, bed-pans. At two I gave
the special medicines and then went back to my
studying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not look at the patient in Bed 11?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. Harrison, she had no special medicine.
At three I again made rounds and found the patient
in Bed 11 was dead. I called my supervisor
and failed to get her. I then called the general
superintendent. She told me to draw the curtains
around Bed 11 and wait further orders until Dr.
Mattus came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Dr. Sterling, Junior, came within the
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
next fifteen minutes. Dr. Sterling and Dr. Mattus
rolled the bed off of the ward and into the elevator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not see the patient again. I finished my
ward duties by seven, woke the remaining patients
and told them that the patient in Bed 11 had been
operated on in the night and removed to the Surgical
Clinic, like Aunt Roenna told me to....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did she tell you that?&rdquo; Cub Sterling inquired.</p>
<p>The girl hesitated and flushed. For the moment
she seemed to have lost her control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t. I had forgotten. Miss Willis, the
night supervisor told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you very much, Miss Kerr. Are there
any questions any of you gentlemen wish to ask
Miss Kerr, before she is relieved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been in training?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two years and five months, Dr. Harrison. I
finish in December.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you again,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur said as she
rose, and then finished:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the people concerned in this, Miss Kerr,
you are the youngest. Please do not forget that
two years ago you took an oath concerning silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princeton Peters, who was sitting by the door,
rose and opened it for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, my dear!&rdquo; he beamed.</p>
<p>No man felt she had told the entire truth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>After her departure, they sat silently awaiting
the next witness. The horror of the thing seemed
to have enveloped them.</p>
<p>The night orderly on B Ward entered. A thin,
tubercular looking man with frightened eyes.
Everything about him seemed collapsed, and yet
still able to move.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur looked up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, William. How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s appreciation spread over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well as can be expected, thank you, Doctor.
How&rsquo;s yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Prissy, Bear, Cub, and Harrison
with a respectful &ldquo;Good morning, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;William,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur began addressing
him before he could enter into a personal conversation
with each man, &ldquo;were you on duty last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I was. As usual. And a frightful night,
too, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dr. MacArthur, to begin my rheumatism
was bothering. And then everything seemed to have
hid itself. And then that girl just in here was like a
kitten on a brick, sir. Got my hair prickled, so to
speak, by running back and asking me if I&rsquo;d seen
anybody on the ward about eleven-fifty and then
saying she had <i>felt</i> somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was there any basis for it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None, sir, as I knows. It&rsquo;s true I was in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
kitchen during her feeling spell, so to speak. But,
if you will pardon my remarking, sir, I been on
that ward ten years coming August and it&rsquo;s as
hard to get past me as a watchdog, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, William. I know it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Dr. MacArthur. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many times did the nurse come back?&rdquo;
Hoffbein smiled encouragingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only wunst. And then when she found the
woman dead, sir! I was resting with my eyes shet,
sir, and she well nigh scared me out of my wits!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she frightened?&rdquo; Hoffbein insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t fur me to say, Doctor. I was too mad
at having my rest ruined and too scared myself to
see, sir. It wasn&rsquo;t till Dr. Mattus came that I could
stand away from the wall, sir. When Dr. Cub ...
begging your pardon, son ... Sterling got there
I was all right again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I been in the hospital long as most of you and
I seen death every day, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we know how proud you are of the hospital,
William,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur cut in, &ldquo;and what
a help you have always been to it. So you must
promise me, upon your oath, before these gentlemen,
that you will not repeat to any living soul a
single word of what you know or suspect about the
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur drew the old man&rsquo;s eyes to his
and William replied:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>&ldquo;I promise, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Peters held the door open.</p>
<p>The old man started toward it and turned midway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur, do I ... do I...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do. Tonight and every night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was apparent that every man felt from the
minute William began speaking that he was innocent.
During his interrogation they had relaxed.</p>
<p>In the interim between his exit and the entrance
of Peter Rathbone, Chief Pharmacist, the tension
had fallen considerably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baldy&rdquo; Rathbone shook them out of a reverie.</p>
<p>He had a body like a triangle upside down. His
wide shoulders showed strength and assurance. He
was a youngish middle-aged man. A spreading part
ran up the center of his scalp and connected his
wide forehead with the bald spot on top.</p>
<p>He had been raised an orphan and worked his
way through college at night, and then worked his
way up at the Elijah Wilson. There was a sense of
definite knowledge about the face and figure. His
eyes bore the marks of childhood suffering, but his
smile heartened the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was a deep resonant baritone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Baldy,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur motioned to
the &ldquo;witness chair&rdquo;; then a deep blush steeped his
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
face, and he smiled. Rathbone returned the smile,
took the chair, and ran his eyes over the staff. He
had never seen any of them so perturbed.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur said carefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Er ... er ... Rathbone, did you check the
prescriptions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as possible, sir. A compounded prescription,
as you know, cannot be checked as to relative
quantities and so ... but the ingredients from
the remainder (I understood from the order that
I was to have two capsules compounded, in case the
first failed to take effect) were checked. They tallied
as to substance, perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who compounded the prescription?&rdquo; Dr. Hoffbein
queried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;McInnis, my first assistant, sir. He can be
trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by the telephone bell. It
jarred the men like a steam siren. MacArthur&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;Yes, Heddis. Are you sure? Soon as possible.
Thank you,&rdquo; held the eight men to a dead silence. A
silence which screamed for knowledge.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur placed the hook too carefully
upon the receiver, Hoffbein thought, and then he
spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coniine, gentlemen. One of the deadliest poisons.
Heddis will be over in fifteen minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; Dr. Harrison ejaculated.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hypodermic syringe, then,&rdquo; Bear Sterling
growled.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling jumped as though he had been
shot.</p>
<p>They all turned toward him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Ethridge?&rdquo; Dr. Harrison
put his hand on his knee....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing. Except she was giving hypodermics
all night. She....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s pointer nose had a dreadful
struggle with his judicial brain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make no decisions ... nor allow
ourselves any prejudices, until we are in possession
of all evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were saying, Baldy...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Dr. Heddis believes it was done ...
hypodermically. He suspected coniine and called
me twenty minutes ago, and as a result all of the
medicine closets in Medicine Clinic have just been
checked. Nothing was found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever have any obscure poisons in the pharmacy?&rdquo;
Cub Sterling was leaning arrogantly forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rarely. None, at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you account for the entry of this ...
coniine?&rdquo; Cub Sterling lowered his brows and
scowled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> can&rsquo;t, Dr. Sterling,&rdquo; Rathbone turned his
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
body around and looked through Cub searchingly.
His doming forehead added weight to his eyes.</p>
<p>Cub shifted his position, and Bear Sterling who
had missed the by-play growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it hard to obtain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said is coniine difficult to get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we never have any use for it, I don&rsquo;t
know, Dr. Sterling,&rdquo; he hesitated as if endeavoring
to hide his irritation and then continued, &ldquo;Shall
I find out, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur interposed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good idea. See where and in what quantities the
big pharmaceutical houses have sold coniine within
the last year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we can trace the person quickly that
way,&rdquo; Dr. Barton affirmed.</p>
<p>Rathbone rose and turned, &ldquo;Is there anything
else, gentlemen? I&rsquo;ll let you know directly I find
out. Do you wish all syringes in the hospital
checked, Dr. MacArthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you, gentlemen?&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur turned
toward Harrison and Bear Sterling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of time for that,&rdquo; Hoffbein inserted.
&ldquo;Check the supply sources first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Rathbone was gone they felt as though a
strong support had been removed. His incisive uprightness
rested them; but he had shot them so full
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
of information they were still dazed when Miss
Roenna Kerr entered.</p>
<p>She came, her hair waved, her face firmly set, the
bust and rear defiantly inflated, her enraged vitals
midway between. She had been there as long as any
of them. Her work had always been perfect. She
wore her new pair of bunion-rest shoes.</p>
<p>Princeton Peters took her arm in his, patted her
hand and murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Miss Kerr, brace up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He eased her into the &ldquo;witness chair&rdquo; and tiptoed
back to his own.</p>
<p>He was worth a million dollars to the Elijah
Wilson ... in his way. To every other man in
the room she had appeared <i>too</i> braced!</p>
<p>In response to their &ldquo;good morning,&rdquo; she smiled,
generally, cocked her head on one side and said to
MacArthur:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sent for me, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Kerr,&rdquo; his slow methodical fairness
was beating against his natural inclinations. &ldquo;We
want you to tell us exactly what you know about
the death of the patient in Bed 11, Ward B, Medicine
Clinic, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, before I begin I should like to say that
the Elijah Wilson is as dear to my heart as to any
of yours, and my humiliation is....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>Again Princeton came to the rescue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flopped her bosom, took a snort of air and
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patient in Bed 11, Ward B, was admitted
Sunday as a patient of Dr. Ethridge Sterling,
Senior, under the observation of Dr. Ethridge
Sterling, Junior....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Kerr. But the thing I wish you to report
upon is the nursing-staff angle....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flopped her bosom again and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kexter, my white nurse on Ward B is one
of the finest women I have ever met in the nursing
profession. And she had been most surpassingly
brave through this entire ... investigation....
I think it has come to that, now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trained with us?&rdquo; Dr. Harrison asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Stood second in her class. She has under
her five student nurses into whose records I have
gone most thoroughly ... and who have been
cruelly grilled....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kerr,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur interrupted, &ldquo;we
have all been cruelly grilled as you call it. Please
try to realize that it is not because we suspect your
department ... any more than any other ...
that we are questioning you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur,&rdquo; she bit her lips, &ldquo;my department
has been my life; when it is criticized....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know you do! And so does everybody else
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
concerned,&rdquo; Dr. Harrison interposed. &ldquo;Really Miss
Kerr, please stick to what has happened. Your
niece has night duty on Ward B, I believe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says you gave her orders about what to
say to the patients about the death. Did you?&rdquo; Cub
Sterling had forgotten his manners and become
bitterly stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t on duty, Dr. Ethridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you talk to her over the telephone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. How should I know of the
death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you talk to her on the ward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She inflated entirely and said with a defiant
calm:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Ethridge, I just answered that question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you explain her statement, Miss
Kerr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden terror flicked her china blue eyes. She
dropped the lids instantly and replied with studied
slowness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The child has been through such an ordeal, she
was rattled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bear Sterling shifted, Dr. Harrison stroked his
beard, Dr. MacArthur frowned and took up the
questioning before Cub Sterling had regained his
composure.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;Who has charge of the hypodermic syringes on
your floors, Miss Kerr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white nurse in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has access to them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She and the student nurses on duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At all hours?&rdquo; Bear Sterling rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At <i>all</i> hours, Dr. Sterling. <i>Night</i> as well as
day,&rdquo; she defied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His two words nicked her composure. She questioned
shortly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you questioning my night supervisor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was not available when your niece discovered
the murder, and therefore her testimony would
have no value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was she?&rdquo; Dr. Harrison drawled.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr began to turn purple.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the lavatory, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time did you get into the Clinic this
morning, Miss Kerr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned her defiant eyes upon Cub Sterling
and struck:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At four sharp. The night superintendent had
called me at three-thirty and told me. I came over
immediately. You were still with Dr. MacArthur,
I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again his &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; cut her down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>Dr. MacArthur realized she was useless, so he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Miss Kerr. You have been a great
help. Of course I do not have to ask a person of
your integrity to realize the necessity of silence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princeton took his cue and opened the door.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr rose majestically and smiled inclusively.</p>
<p>She left every man in the room irritated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur soothed, &ldquo;that is
all of the testimony, except Mattus&rsquo; story, and Dr.
Sterling, Ethridge and I went over it with him
while we were awaiting the autopsy findings. Any
questions or decisions before Heddis comes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was Mattus&rsquo; statement?&rdquo; Dr. Harrison
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he found the patient in the condition
Father and I did when he made his rounds, and the
next time he saw her, at three-five, she was dead,&rdquo;
Cub Sterling responded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could the murderer have any animus against
the patients?&rdquo; Barton asked leaning forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not likely,&rdquo; Cub said. &ldquo;One from out of town
and genteel poor, second dispensary admission, and
the last old patient. Been in the hospital before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was interrupted by a knock upon the door
and Dr. Heddis&rsquo; stout, round body, with its piano-post
legs and lion head protruded through the
opening. His wide-set yellow-brown eyes, even in
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
repose, dominated his highly intelligent face. Dr.
MacArthur motioned him into the &ldquo;witness chair&rdquo;
and he began speaking in a high, tired voice which,
because of his increasing deafness, had a sing-song
quality.</p>
<p>In ordinary conversation his impediment required
a &ldquo;raising&rdquo; of his questioner&rsquo;s voice, so upon
a subject of which men spoke in whispers any information
he had to give automatically became a
soliloquy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Morning, gentlemen. Luck, pure luck! Organs
appeared perfectly normal. Began the obscure
tests alphabetically. It would have taken two days
to reach coniine, if my nose hadn&rsquo;t been haunted
by an almost imperceptible odor; after about a
half hour my brain finally diagnosed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The tests are conclusive. She died of an infusion
of coniine, C8H17N, <i>per os</i> or hypodermically.
Puncture makes syringe theory conclusive as coniine
administered <i>per os</i> would be remarked by the
patient. Smells like mouse urine. Also acts locally as
a caustic. Burning the mouth. Itching of the
throat. Dizziness. Nausea. Tormenting thirst.
Paralysis of the sural muscles.... The patient
had none of these symptoms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned toward Cub Sterling questioningly.
So did every other man in the room. Cub&rsquo;s &ldquo;No&rdquo;
was verbal as well as muscular.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the leonine head rolled heavily, &ldquo;one
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
and one-half to two grains administered hypodermically
would be fatal ... in a very short time
... before a patient would have the agony symptoms
penetrate to the drug deadened nerve centers.
Before she could rouse herself the paralysis of the
peripheral endings of the motor nerves had set in;
also the deadening of the sensory nerves had begun.
The dominant action, however, is upon the motor
system. Death ensued from paralysis of respiration.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped to draw breath and no man interrupted.
Toxicology was only a branch of the science
upon which this man was an authority.</p>
<p>Dr. Heddis continued: &ldquo;All organs appeared
normal. The stomach content, the organs rich in
blood ... liver, spleen, kidneys, lungs ... appeared
healthy. But they ... all ... responded
positively to the solubility, crystallization
and Melzer&rsquo;s tests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prissy could stand the tension no longer. He
screamed, &ldquo;Of what plant is coniine the active principal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hemlock!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fatal hemlock!&rdquo; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s voice was
heavy as he quoted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then Socrates lay down upon his back and
the person who had administered the poison
went up to him and examined for a little time
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
his feet and legs and then squeezing his foot
strongly, asked whether he felt him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. Heddis, who never had any trouble understanding
Harrison, also knew his Plato. He nodded
and continued:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Socrates replied that he did not. He then did
the same to his legs, and proceeding upwards in
this way, showed us that he was cold and stiff,
and he afterwards approached him and said to
us that when the effect of the poison reached the
heart Socrates would depart....&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heddis threw out his hands helplessly.</p>
<p>Princeton, who was weak upon the classics,
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sinister!&rdquo; he breathed heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Used to be used for whooping cough,&rdquo; Cub
Sterling clipped gruffly.</p>
<p>The information, for the shadow of a second before
Dr. Heddis began speaking again, made the
pupils of Hoffbein&rsquo;s eyes dilate slightly. Bear Sterling&rsquo;s
eyes were pin points needling themselves past
the grave figure of MacArthur and into the long
face of Heddis, who continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can be prepared synthetically by means of the
same cadaveric alkaloid, or ptomaine, that is
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
formed in putrefaction of cadavers, that is, cadaverine
or penta-methylene-diamine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoffbein began to squirm slightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The injection, C8H17N (<i>Conium maculatum</i>),
presumably combined with lactic acid is
colorless and gradually turns yellow and brown in
the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Barton rose and leaned close to Dr. Heddis&rsquo;
ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In your opinion would the person who gave this
... drug ... require a knowledge of chemistry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Heddis pressed his plump thumb into his
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, definitely. But ... all that a man
needs to know of dynamite to destroy a city is that
it will explode. Rathbone is checking supply
sources, I understand. I&rsquo;m not hopeful....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged his thick shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A medical student with a flare for toxicology
could have made it synthetically. Anybody with a
medical background could....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suggest,&rdquo; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s voice was patiently
fighting the rising tension, &ldquo;that we separate
and think it over privately until after lunch.
Men under a strain as long as this has been upon
Ethridge and Dr. MacArthur are not at their mental
best ... you both need rest; you have borne
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
up magnificently.... Let&rsquo;s re-convene here at
two, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Heddis turned from the door:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you need me, MacArthur....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Hoffbein blocked his exit. &ldquo;One question before
we go. Is there much hysteria on the ward?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing visible,&rdquo; Cub Sterling snapped.
&ldquo;There is tension of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">A terrible desire to get away from it all for just
fifteen minutes ... to forget! ... to run away
and rest ... made Cub Sterling walk through the
ground floor of his clinic and start down the accident
room steps toward Otto&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Halfway down he hesitated.</p>
<p>Three minutes later he walked through Ward B,
ascertained from a student nurse that Dr. James
was at lunch and Dr. Mattus still with the students.
Then he opened the door of Room Two.</p>
<p>Rested, relaxed eyes, whose black shadows had
disappeared, whose violet shades sung against the
white pillows, turned peacefully toward his measuring
brown ones.</p>
<p>The girl took a cigarette from between her lips
and began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I slept like a lamb. My leg doesn&rsquo;t hurt. I told
the interne a nurse brought me the cigarettes and
they quieted my nerves, so your shirt-tail is clear.
She let me keep them.... I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot.
<span class="pb" id="Page_104">104</span>
Look here! Today is Tuesday! There is absolutely
no sense keeping me here, forever....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Ethridge Sterling, Junior, closed the door
sharply and strode over to the bed. His features
were flattening. His dark curly hair was dishevelled.
His voice had its &ldquo;&rsquo;Night!&rdquo; quality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are my patient and you are not to get out
of that bed until I say so. I know today is Tuesday
just as well as you do. Possibly better! What you
seem never to realize is that I am a tremendously
busy man. A Physician-in-Chief works! You are
not the only patient in this hospital ... but God
knows you are the most petulant! Spending all
your days lying there thinking up problems to
hound me with! Tying yourself in knots of complications,
instead of realizing you are a damned lot
luckier than you deserve!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her mouth had been contracting slowly. When
Cub stopped for breath she opened it quickly and
began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be right about the luck, Doctor Sterling.
But one thing medicine has failed completely
to teach you is that people without money still have
pride! Do you think I&rsquo;ve enjoyed lying here for
ninety-six hours having you throw up to me that
the Attorney-General will pay my bills? Do you?
There is a rumor that the Attorney-General is going
to be in the next Cabinet. I was riding with him
to try and find out. If I had found out, I&rsquo;d have
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
had a scoop big enough to pay all the damned-old
bills you care to sling at me....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well ... I didn&rsquo;t find out! But that doesn&rsquo;t
keep me from &lsquo;growing the bills.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve got to hold
my job to meet them and I&rsquo;ve got to get out to do
it! And all the medical hysterics you could ever
throw doesn&rsquo;t change the facts. I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice broke unexpectedly and she covered
her head with a pillow.</p>
<p>Under the sheet Cub could see her body beginning
to stiffen.</p>
<p>He reached over gently and took the cigarette
from her fingers. Then he looked around for an
ash-tray, saw none, and vacantly placed the cigarette
between his own lips. The harassment of the
morning had drained from his face. A deep concern
replaced it.</p>
<p>His voice was bantering and slow:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like the phlebitis is traveling to your
mind, little Salscie. Let&rsquo;s take it step by step. The
job; it&rsquo;s intact. The doctor who asked me to take
you in has been talking to the City Editor about
you every day. Mistake was I ordered no visitors
and no flowers and so you thought they had abandoned
you. You may stay a month so far as they
are concerned. The job will be there when you get
back. If you stay a month, probably by then our
friction may have worn itself out and you&rsquo;ll begin
to see how nice I really am. Want to try?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The pillow remained inert, but the feet and legs
began to relax. Cub cut his eye over the body and
began talking again. He decided silently that when
the breasts stopped rising, he&rsquo;d quit talking....</p>
<p>He took the cigarette from his lips and moistened
them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the bills, I&rsquo;ve been a rotter. I should have
told you that the paper was paying them, or the
hospital, or ... but I was pushed into the situation
uninformed. I didn&rsquo;t know whether you were
the king&rsquo;s mistress or the governor&rsquo;s. I didn&rsquo;t care
a damn! And then some terribly, horribly important
situations arose in the hospital and instead of
thinking the thing out, I bungled it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heaving in the breasts became slower, and
Cub said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the bills, I&rsquo;ll do whatever you want me
to. The hospital will take your note, or I&rsquo;ll lend
you the money myself. There is only one thing I
will not do. I <i>will not</i> let you walk out of this hospital
until I am absolutely sure that you are perfectly
well. So make up your mind to that! I&rsquo;m
sorry if I&rsquo;ve been cruel.... I didn&rsquo;t mean to!
Probably I&rsquo;m just too stupid to be kind, Salscie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heaves died completely. He sat absolutely
silent.</p>
<p>With her left hand she caught the edge of the
pillow case and pulled the pillow beside her upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
the bed. Her eyes looked straight and completely
into his. Her voice was contrite and admiring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the first man who ever offered to lend
me money and didn&rsquo;t paw me at the same time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub laughed heartily, and then snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m stupid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her dimples danced and then she sobered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;m well, will you come to see me...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub held her eyes to his and nodded emphatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you say I may! As often as you&rsquo;ll
let me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began lowering her lids and filled the silence
with words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub sat very still and curiosity made her raise
her eyes to his again. When they were safely locked,
he said, slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;R-e-a-l-l-y!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little flecks of sunlight in the room began
cascading around her hair, an inside blush centered
in her neck.</p>
<p>Cub sat perfectly still and watched her. She
knew he was watching her and she also knew that
something which made her sick with joy was
squirming inside of her. She began speaking desperately
and with frightful haste:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might have to hang your legs out of a window
when you come to dinner. When I get a card
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
table up, there&rsquo;s not much extra space, you know
... but ... oh, by the way ... could you
steal a knife and fork from the doctors&rsquo; dining
room, do you think? Not steal, but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub laughed joyously.</p>
<p>Her face was sober.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;Cigarettes, a knife and fork, ...
anything else, Salscie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Cub. What&rsquo;s the trouble you spoke about
in the hospital?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The banter slipped from his features and his
left shoulder began to rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing for you to worry about. Just ...
some ... friction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took her right hand from under the covers
and reached over and caught his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes met hers and he increased his pressure
on the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! You can&rsquo;t cause everything, Salscie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he rose abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better get back, though. Also I&rsquo;ll make a
survey of the knife and fork situation. That pack
of cigarettes will be gone by tonight, won&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lay back among the pillows and nodded
slowly.</p>
<p>Cub beat his way through the singing air and
closed the door securely behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h2 id="c4">&raquo;IV&laquo;
<br />The First Doll</h2>
<p>Bear Sterling hurried back to
take a look at his brain tumor. He had stopped for
a few words with Cub, but Cub had insisted that he
must get back to his clinic and relieve Mattus. So
after finishing with the brain tumor, which was
coming along nicely, Bear went to his own office,
shut the door, lay down upon a couch and went to
sleep.</p>
<p>There was a crisis ahead. He needed a nap.</p>
<p>Dr. Barton did his rounds, discussed three unusual
children with his resident, did as much work
and appeared as natural as possible for an hour,
and then filled his pipe and began the process of
elimination on the evidence.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison had a fifteen minute survey with
his resident; afterward locked himself up in his
laboratory and settled down to a &ldquo;thinking
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoffbein returned to his clinic and tried to behave
as though nothing had happened. His consultant
and resident nearly died of excitement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>Dr. MacArthur cleared his desk and endeavored
to clear his mind. He had just rung for his secretary
and prepared to go upstairs and lie down in
a vacant interne room and get some rest, when
Prissy Paton and Princeton Peters slipped in and
closed the door behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give us a minute, MacArthur?&rdquo; Peters&rsquo;
voice was sepulchral.</p>
<p>Prissy stood in the background and looked as if
he were going to cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. What&rsquo;s on your minds? Sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat upon the edges of the chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Peters, and tell him,&rdquo; Prissy prompted
in his treble.</p>
<p>Princeton&rsquo;s eyes took on their purple mist and
he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear MacArthur, what we are about to tell you
is drawn out of us by our great love for the Elijah
Wilson ... and for you. We feel you must know,
and we could not tell you in front of Bear. It
would have killed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? Get to the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night at midnight, Dr. Paton and I were
coming up the corridor from Woman&rsquo;s Clinic ...
I had been to see about the eyes of the president of
the Woman&rsquo;s College ... sudden attack ...
and Ethridge came out of the door of Medicine
Clinic just ahead of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>Dr. MacArthur put his hands under his desk
and gripped his knees. His voice, however, was perfectly
calm, as he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been mistaken, Dr. Peters. Ethridge
said he was in his rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the saddest part. We heard him say it!
And we could not both be mistaken about Ethridge&rsquo;s
back. His queer walk, MacArthur. One
shoulder higher than the other.... And we both
saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you say yourself that neither of you saw
his face, Dr. Peters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; Prissy purred, &ldquo;we did
not see his face ... but I would swear upon my
mother&rsquo;s Bible that it was he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask him,&rdquo; MacArthur&rsquo;s voice was decisive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, MacArthur, don&rsquo;t act hastily! It would
be futile to ask <i>him</i>, and if it were not for the horrible
slur upon the hospital....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princeton&rsquo;s pleading was so intense that he did
not note Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s silent anger, but Prissy
sensed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must get some rest, MacArthur,&rdquo; he
soothed. &ldquo;Come on Peters,&rdquo; and at the door he
finished. &ldquo;Great decisions must be made and we
shall not meet them unprepared.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">Miss Evelina Kerr, student nurse, lay prone
upon her bed, sobbing bitterly, silently, rackingly.
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
Outside her door a supervisor from Medicine Clinic,
off duty at the time, sat erect in a straight back
chair, reading one of Edgar Wallace&rsquo;s novels.</p>
<p>Up and down the hall of the Nurses&rsquo; Home voices
rose and fell. The nurses on night shift were awakening.
Miss Roenna Kerr, head nurse in Medicine
Clinic, sailed down the polished floor and as her
reflection preceded her, a loud whisper sung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foots!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voices ceased, and the doors filled with
blond, black, straw-colored, yellow and red heads in
all degrees of disarray. Thirty pairs of eyes saw
her switch her stern to a halt in front of the supervisor
and smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mattie! How sweet of you to stay by my child!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mattie said deferentially:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kerr, anything ... anything that I
could do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kerr knew Mattie was playing policeman
on orders from the Superintendent of Nurses, but
she also knew that Mattie was accustomed to taking
her own orders. Her lips drew to a beautiful firming
and she said huskily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Having you in training and upon my staff,
Mattie, has been one of the really great joys of a
very trying life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mattie began disintegrating, and Miss Kerr put
her hand upon the knob of her niece&rsquo;s door and
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
was inside before the supervisor could moisten her
lips.</p>
<p>The room was inky, the dark blue window shade
was pulled even with the sill. Miss Kerr whispered,
involuntary, &ldquo;Evelina!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two sobs inverted their explosion. The girl sat
up beating the air. Miss Kerr ignored her agony
and began relentlessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is no time for hysterics. Come on and tell
me! What did you tell them...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Auntie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The General Staff.&rdquo; Each letter of each word
came bitingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, Aunt Eeenie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kerr threw out her chin, and enunciated
carefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No woman can talk to that many men about
nothing for half an hour. You fail to realize Evelina
that everything you have you owe to me. Your
training, your education, your clothes, even the
straightening of your teeth I paid for!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl cringed in the blackness. Her voice was
subservient:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... I ... know it, Auntie. I swear ...
to God ... I didn&rsquo;t tell them ... and I never
will! I&rsquo;d get thrown out of training ... before
... I&rsquo;d....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kerr&rsquo;s words sealed her lips. They beat into
her brain:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;A private who accuses his general ... is always
court-martialed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she turned upon her heel and closed the
door after her.</p>
<p>For ten minutes the student nurse sobbed dryly.
Complete exhaustion then smothered the sobs. She
fell asleep.</p>
<p class="tb">In the nurses&rsquo; cafeteria the first group were beginning
to choose their lunches. The white uniforms
of the graduate nurses and the blue uniforms of
the student nurses with their white collars and
cuffs reflected the glare from the thin curtains at
the sunlit windows.</p>
<p>Near a table occupied by four student nurses
sat Rose Standish, head nurse in the accident
room. Her small ivory face was buried in a volume
of &ldquo;Sonnets from the Portuguese&rdquo; and she guided
the teaspoons of gelatine and whipped cream into
her mouth by a sense of feeling, not sight. Her
outer eye was transferring to her inner one the
charm of a mind drenched in the world&rsquo;s great love.</p>
<p>The student nurse with a raucous Kansas whine
was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened to &rsquo;Lina Kerr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Why?&rdquo; responded a flat Alabama
drawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw her in the corridor with two supervisors at
ten o&rsquo;clock and Minnie says they&rsquo;ve got her locked
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
in her room and won&rsquo;t let anybody talk to her.
She ... she ... looked frightful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where have you been for the last week?&rdquo; a Virginian
purred. &ldquo;Three people have died on the
ward where she has night duty and they all are trying
to blame it on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you lost your mind, Lizzie?&rdquo; sneered the
Alabamian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you don&rsquo;t believe me, why did you ask
me? They had her up before the General Staff this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Honest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Honest! That&rsquo;s sweet for her, if you ask
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumping Jehosophat! You think she did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Of course not. Dr. Cub Sterling was the
doctor on all of the cases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the mention of his name the conversation she
had just been hearing re-echoed in Rose Standish&rsquo;s
mind and she looked up just in time to catch the
shrug of the girl&rsquo;s thin shoulders and her smirk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; the girl shrugged again.</p>
<p>Rose Standish closed her book and rose. She
wanted air, and plenty of it. Ever since the second
year of her training she had had a very secret passion
for Cub Sterling. Ever since that time he
caught her on the stairway behind the pharmacy
kissing ... she blushed when she thought about
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
it ... Tony Watson, one of his internes ...
and never told anybody, and then when Tony had
pneumonia and died, he had let her help to nurse
him and ... be with him ... at the last.</p>
<p>She reached the sun-parlor of the Nurses&rsquo; Home
and collapsed into a chair. After all these five years
the thought of Tony could do that to her! After all
these five years ... and it was because that
thought could turn her body to liquid soap that she
still was so deeply grateful to Cub Sterling. He
was white as chalk and always had been. Gold
through and through ... and those student
nurses suspected him of murdering patients. The
dirty cats! The rotten little worms! The nasty
pigs!</p>
<p>Why, when he found her in Tony&rsquo;s arms halfway
down that pitch-black stairway, he had pretended
he didn&rsquo;t recognize either of them. He had laughed
and said, &ldquo;My mistake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then when he had reached the lower doorway,
before he opened it, he turned ... she could
hear his voice, even now....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a disease worth having. Good luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good luck ... good luck. She was looking out
of the window at the sunshine; she had long ago
quit crying. The grating voice of a furious woman
came up the corridor toward her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I think, Miss Williams, that the nursing
staff should request Dr. MacArthur to cast his attention
<span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
upon other departments, if you know what
I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice reached the sun-parlor. It came from
the firm lips of Miss Roenna Kerr.</p>
<p>And it settled Rose Standish&rsquo;s fate.</p>
<p>She rose, respectfully slipped out of another
door and into the main corridor of the hospital.</p>
<p class="tb">Doctors Peters and Paton closed the door to
Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s office softly behind him, and Dr.
MacArthur was too weak to get up and open it.</p>
<p>He felt like a man ordered to fit a jigsaw puzzle
during an earthquake.</p>
<p>Somewhere among the group of people he had
seen this morning there had been a liar. Out of them
some person ... in whom the hospital had placed
a trust ... had lied to him, face to face. Coniine....</p>
<p>Malice and all uncharitableness, deceit and hate,
murder and meanness. Coniine....</p>
<p>He cradled his head in his arms and moaned.
Cub Sterling, his godchild, almost his own son, and
with the exception of the old orderly William, every
witness.... And now two members of the staff.</p>
<p>How in heaven&rsquo;s name could Cub ever clear himself
... now....</p>
<p>He was so deep in his misery that he did not hear
the door open and quietly close. It was the voice
which roused him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>A small nurse with an elfin face and large gray
eyes was standing beside him. She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Dr. MacArthur, may I speak to you,
suh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lifted his head and motioned her to a chair.
She remained standing, her upright little body
with its slim legs and small, finely arched feet,
motionless.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur recognized that she had something
tremendously important to tell him. He
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you, Miss ... er...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose Standish, suh,&rdquo; she supplied.</p>
<p class="tb">When the staff re-convened, Hoffbein was irritated.
He had gone about his routine and lunched
in the doctors&rsquo; dining room. While he was there no
other member of the staff entered and it had made
him out a fool to all the internes. Looked like he
wasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;in&rdquo; on the decisions. Prissy and Princeton
had had ample time to repent their rash disclosure
and were afraid; MacArthur might face them
with it before Harrison and Bear Sterling. Dr.
Harrison and Bear Sterling looked tired and uncertain.
Dr. Barton&rsquo;s open face had assumed its
judgmatical mask. Dr. MacArthur eyed each man
carefully.</p>
<p>It was plain that all of them were ready to talk.
He sat erect in his chair and prepared for battle.
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
The small chatter died out, and the seven men
silently awaited Cub Sterling.</p>
<p>At four minutes past two he entered. His bushy,
curly hair was rumpled, his left shoulder was hysterically
high. In his right hand he carried a small
doll in a pink organdie dress and bonnet that continued
crying, &ldquo;Ma-Ma, Ma-Ma.&rdquo; He seemed unaware
of the noise; but it pierced the other men
like a jigsaw. They all jumped and Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s
face for the first time appeared blank.
Bear Sterling was the first to regain his equilibrium;
after all he had dealt with the man as a child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub. What in the hell have you got there?&rdquo; he
growled.</p>
<p>But Cub strode obliviously past him and Dr.
Barton took the doll. She stopped crying immediately.
That and Dr. Barton&rsquo;s action brought
Cub to a halt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur, that doll was found by Bessie
Ellis upon the foot of her crib in Ward B when she
awoke this morning. Evidently a present someone
had put there during the night. Nobody on the
ward knew anything about it. It must have been
left by....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is Bessie Ellis, son?&rdquo; Dr. Harrison
soothed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a nephritis case we have had on the ward
for several months. Six years old and cute. Barton
and Father know her.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a pet,&rdquo; Bear affirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sinister!&rdquo; Princeton Peters murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Real evidence,&rdquo; Bear&rsquo;s brows were thunderously
low. &ldquo;She must bear the finger prints of the
murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; Cub barked. &ldquo;She has been handled
by at least ten people since Bessie found her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then everybody began talking at once and
Dr. MacArthur rapped for silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; his voice was commanding, &ldquo;each
of you has had two hours in which to think over
the situation. I need not remind you that our decisions
must be the sum of our wisdom, and reached
without emotion. Therefore it is my suggestion
that we, one at a time, state our conclusions, beginning
as we are sitting. Dr. Peters what is your
opinion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should rather, MacArthur, reserve....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Out with it. We&rsquo;ll never get anywhere that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princeton&rsquo;s lavender eyes paled with uncertainty.
Cub&rsquo;s sensational entrance had wobbled his
mind.</p>
<p>He moistened his thick lips and his voice lost its
usual certainty. It actually contained a tremor
when he began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always, as you know, gentlemen, deferred
to you upon any question about which I was
uncertain. I have always valued the opinion of
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
specialists above the opinions of ... even of
friends ... where any patient, whether dear to
me or not, was involved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Need I say, my dear MacArthur, that the
Elijah Wilson is dearer to me than a beloved patient,
even? The condition is so horribly serious that
I am against delay. It should be referred immediately,
in my opinion, to a specialist, namely, the
police. I feel it should be turned over, I repeat,
immediately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His speech fell upon them like descending plaster.
Somewhere physically they all jumped. Bear
grit his teeth and snorted, Harrison scowled, MacArthur
gripped his knees....</p>
<p>Nobody spoke, except Barton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m against it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was flat and final.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Paton purred. &ldquo;I, personally, am for
it. Wholeheartedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; Dr. Harrison exploded before Dr.
Barton could reply. &ldquo;Sheer, childish nonsense. Are
you out to kill the hospital or the murderer, Peters?
I repeat, some linen is too foul to wash in public!
It has taken forty years and more to build up the
reputation of this place and you are planning to
destroy it....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dr. Harrison, I&rsquo;m not &lsquo;planning&rsquo; anything.
Dr. MacArthur asked me for an opinion and
I gave it. That&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, Peters. No offense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The antagonism stiffened.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur intervened, &ldquo;Your opinion, Dr.
Paton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree entirely with Dr. Peters. Men trained
in the detection of criminals are the men to catch
murderers.&rdquo; Prissy folded his hands righteously
and sat in a waxy pose.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur ignored his silent disapproval
and passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against the police, suh. Entirely against them.
Their intervention is the way, to my thinking, to
muddle the whole thing ... and take an awful
chance of making the story public. Something must
undoubtedly be done, and done quickly, but what,
suh, I frankly do not know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing which seems to me possible is to have
every person connected with the affair given a
psychiatric examination by Dr. Hoffbein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoffbein&rsquo;s back straightened and he smiled
deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s in his line, it seems,&rdquo; Dr. Barton finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m against that ... flat!&rdquo; Bear Sterling
mumbled. &ldquo;In the first place the only hope of ever
catching the murderer is to pretend we are not
looking for him. At least twenty people are under
suspicion as possibilities. Remove any one of those
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
twenty people and you may be removing the murderer.
Every person in connection with that ward
in any capacity whatsoever must continue there
until the murderer is caught. Otherwise ... we
senselessly throw our needle into a hay stack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Bear,&rdquo; MacArthur replied. &ldquo;Absolutely
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about the medical student doing routine
tests on this ward?&rdquo; Prissy interposed. &ldquo;Dr. Heddis
said anybody could, with medical knowledge....
What type of lad is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;False clue,&rdquo; Cub snapped. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been home
with the mumps for ten days. The interne on the
floor has been doing his work....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what about Dr. ... er...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;James. Sarah James,&rdquo; Cub defied. &ldquo;The doll
rules her out of the last one, at least. She was out of
town yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Barton who had been considering Bear&rsquo;s
statement replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see your point, Dr. Sterling, and it is an excellent
one ... but I failed, evidently, to express
myself clearly.&rdquo; His voice was perfectly even. &ldquo;I
was thinking of an examination of that student
nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling sat forward and clipped, &ldquo;So was
I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father turned his searching eyes into him
and demanded, &ldquo;What about her?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>There was a knock at the door and it opened almost
immediately. The erect figure of the Chief
Pharmacist shifted their attention. Baldy Rathbone
held in his hand a sheaf of telegrams.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling&rsquo;s eyes followed those of the other
men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry to interrupt, gentlemen, but
this, Dr. MacArthur, is the report about where
coniine may be obtained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out the yellow sheets toward Dr. MacArthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Baldy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is available in gram quantities at the United
Wholesale Drug Company in New York, Parke
Davis in Detroit, and the Burroughs Welcome
Agents in San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anywhere else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur took the telegrams. Baldy hesitated,
massaged his shiny spot and finished:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They report no recent sales, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blind alley!&rdquo; Bear Sterling grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid so, Doctor. Anything else, Dr. MacArthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur looked over his glasses and shook
his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I can think of. Thank you for your
promptness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Heddis asked me to say, sir, that he has just
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
checked the Medical Library. There have been no
reference works upon the subject out for several
years. He, therefore, feels that the student body is
cleared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you again, Baldy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask a question?&rdquo; Cub Sterling was clipping
his words. &ldquo;Will it keep long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Baldy was resentful of his superior
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coniine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned and looked Cub Sterling full in the
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Doctor. We have never handled it
in the pharmacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was gone before Cub could reply; but his
parting speech brought an involuntary nod from
Doctors Peters and Paton, and Hoffbein pierced
Cub with a barometer stare. Bear Sterling appeared
to have missed the stab.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murderers always have motives. If we could
find the motive.... What about that girl and
Hoffbein&rsquo;s examining her. Where&rsquo;s the harm?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The harm, Bear,&rdquo; Dr. Harrison pulled his
beard, &ldquo;is (you will pardon me, Hoffbein, and correct
me if am wrong, please?) that presuming she
is the murderer, any examination different from
that given any other person might frighten her
into a temporary respite, but it would not put us
any nearer a solution.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. Perfectly true.&rdquo; Hoffbein&rsquo;s words
were enunciated with a finality, though Cub Sterling
thought he hated to say them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in view of the paper I found upon my desk
when I returned at two o&rsquo;clock such an examination
would seriously hinder our apprehension of her
... if she is the murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What paper, Dr. MacArthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I told you? I&rsquo;m sorry. A typewritten
sheet ... here it is ... which states, Dr. Hoffbein
... that because of two low marks she received
in a course in which Ethridge was lecturing
last month, she has dropped from seven to seventeenth
in her class and will not be in line for a staff
job upon graduation. She cried straight through
for three nights afterward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper was still shielding the pudgy faces of
Doctors Paton and Peters, so Barton, the man
furthest from them asked, &ldquo;Who brought it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. My door was open and I found it
upon my desk. It is signed ... also upon the
typewriter ... &lsquo;A Student Nurse.&rsquo; Gentlemen,
we will never accomplish anything ... unless we
come to some conclusions. Will you please give
us your opinion, Dr. Hoffbein?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Hoffbein&rsquo;s eyes turned a liquid black. He
folded his precise head on one side and each word
settled itself upon the air before its successor was
spoken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, I am not in favor of the police. A
mental criminal is a mental case. A murder of this
type is undoubtedly a mental criminal. A very
clever, otherwise normal and possibly brilliant intellect.
A man ... er ... a person quite out of
scope of ... a police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shrugged the police, with a final hiss, off his
thin shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are your personal impressions, Dr. Hoffbein?&rdquo;
Bear Sterling rumbled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... I ... er ... as a psychiatrist ...
I cannot afford to have personal opinions, Dr. Sterling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, for heaven&rsquo;s sake! What d&rsquo;y&rsquo;<i>think</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Hoffbein&rsquo;s little pigeon breast heaved. His
eyes had completely lost their whites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... I ... I ... think,&rdquo; he hesitated,
and Bear cut in&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be so damn slow about it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Hoffbein flared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my impression that action ... drastic
... and terrible should be quickly taken to apprehend
this dangerous man ... and that action
should come through the psychiatric service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last Bear Sterling caught the insinuations
which hovered thunderously over the room. He
turned too purple for speech, so Dr. Harrison laid
him upon a sofa and murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember your heart, old timer. Remember
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
your heart. Nothing to be alarmed about. &lsquo;Just a
symptom of your disease.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he laughed heartily, and Dr. Otto
Hoffbein ducked like a beaten boxer. &ldquo;A symptom
of your disease&rdquo; is a psychiatric term.</p>
<p>Cub Sterling got his father a glass of water. His
hand trembled as he held it. Barton eased a pillow
under his head. Peters and Paton sat like frightened
schoolboys in the corner. Hoffbein was still
cowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, Bear?&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur asked leaning
over him. Dr. Harrison turned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the situation. It has to be met. You are
going to accomplish nothing by fighting. Every
man in this room knows that between last night
and this morning a woman was murdered in this
hospital. As a result there have been some near
murders since....&rdquo; he gave Hoffbein another
look and his eye lit upon Dr. Paton and Dr. Peters....
&ldquo;Actions speak louder than words. If you
love the Elijah Wilson, as you have spent the day
saying you do, then quit &lsquo;emoting&rsquo; and begin to
think!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Police as a solution! Out of the question, entirely.
Impossible to catch the criminal if he, she
or it, knows it is shadowed, let alone what police
would do to the reputation of the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suggestion number two. Turn the night student
nurse over to psychiatrists. Impossible, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
the very good reason given by Dr. MacArthur.
Let alone the cruelty of the situation should she be
innocent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suggestion number three. Turn the whole
thing over to the psychiatrists. Understand perfectly,
gentlemen, that I am casting no slurs upon
psychiatry, when it stays within its limits. Hoffbein
points out this is a mental criminal. That&rsquo;s
within its limits. Suppose we turned the whole
thing over to you, Hoffbein? Had you thought how
long it would take you and your entire force to examine
twenty people? Thirty new patients a month
is all you claim you are equipped to handle and
give them the proper attention, and these twenty
which the hospital would turn over would have to
have a great deal more than just that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would take you ... every man working
day and night ... and nobody seeing to the clinic
... two weeks to give us any kind of a report.
Two weeks sitting upon dynamite!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life. Our problem is this, as I see it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To catch the murderer, quickly, quietly, and
without creating any suspicion whatever throughout
the institution. We have got to keep our face,
or ruin the hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How to catch the murderer, I frankly do not
know. But that is the situation, as I see it now. I
suggest we take it as such and work it out
here....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Bear Sterling was sitting up again, and Dr.
MacArthur was back at his desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the solution, Harrison,&rdquo; he said calmly.
&ldquo;Put a nurse in the bed in which the three patients
have been murdered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you crazy, MacArthur?&rdquo; Hoffbein&rsquo;s voice
was at last hysterical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I hope not,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s voice was
deadly calm. &ldquo;But today I have had the privilege
of seeing such cool, calm courage exhibited by a
person who really loves this hospital as to make me
proud to be here ... even ... now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nurse came to me after the meeting this
morning ... one of our graduates ... and volunteered
to go into that bed as a patient. Think it
over, gentlemen. That&rsquo;s a solution, d&rsquo;y&rsquo;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s words lay over them like
spring rain. Some men they heartened. Some they
chilled. All they impressed.</p>
<p>Only Dr. Harrison spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I&rsquo;m a friend of hers,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>They were silent so long it upset Dr. Peters.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose she is murdered, Dr. MacArthur? We
couldn&rsquo;t <i>allow</i> it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Peters, this nurse knew of the murders,
that is why she offered to go there. Can&rsquo;t you understand
... that? I brought out that she might
be murdered and she countered with&rdquo; ... he put
one hand in front of his mouth ... &ldquo;that her life
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
was a small thing compared to the reputation of
the Elijah Wilson Hospital and the Medicine
Clinic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling lifted his wild head and snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shouldn&rsquo;t take those chances ... for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Dr. MacArthur sat perfectly straight
and lied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not. She&rsquo;s taking them for the hospital.
<i>She</i> wants to take them. Suppose we vote upon it,
gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Peters?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am against subjecting any nurse to danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Paton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... I ... agree with Peters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Barton?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She seems to me ... the solution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Hoffbein?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to be allowed to give her an examination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. But if she goes on the ward, she must be
in bed within an hour. Do I take it you favor her
offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoffbein acquiesced hesitantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Harrison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret the danger, but I agree with you, MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Sterling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree, MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethridge?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too much to ask....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody asked it, son. She volunteered. And
with my vote, and Heddis&rsquo; advice, I take it that
your decision is, gentlemen, that this nurse within
an hour becomes a patient in Bed 11, Ward B,
of Medicine Clinic ... and God willing ...
catches the murderer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it as natural as possible, Ethridge. Have
your father and Mattus look at her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any hypodermics?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not. You agree, gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they had risen Princeton Peters&rsquo; eyes had
purpled and he asked reverently:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is she, MacArthur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose Standish, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub Sterling, who was standing in the doorway,
turned as though someone had slapped him upon
the back. His left shoulder was high.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<h2 id="c5">&raquo;V&laquo;
<br />A Brave Nurse</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kexter,&rdquo; Miss Kerr still
bore her rump and bust inflated, &ldquo;this is the new
patient for Ward B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beside her stood Rose Standish. She wore a plain
blue coat suit and a small black hat pulled down
to her gray eyes.</p>
<p>Miss Kexter turned from Miss Kerr and looked
at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo, Miss Standish,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You sick?&rdquo;
and reached for the small suitcase.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hope not ... much,&rdquo; Miss Standish&rsquo;s ivory
face was somber. &ldquo;Dr. Sterling thinks I may have
a bum lung. In for observation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They walked into the ward and Miss Kerr observed,
&ldquo;Two vacant beds. Oh, yes, that patient in
21 went home, didn&rsquo;t she? Put Miss Standish in
that bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Standish looked upset. Trained nurses
haven&rsquo;t much use for a member of their profession
who has the chicken-heartedness to succumb to
physical ailments. And Miss Kerr&rsquo;s manner plainly
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
said so. But Rose Standish had not been head
nurse in the accident room three years without being
able to think quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please, Miss Kerr, mayn&rsquo;t I be put in that
vacant bed over there, by the window?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kerr, who had suspected something from
the first and thought that the vacant bed she had
forgotten had forestalled Dr. Sterling&rsquo;s plans,
snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. Any patient with a suspected
lung should not be near a window ... and a nurse
ought to know better than to want to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The patients, who were too sick to be wheeled
out upon the porch, looked on with interest. Mrs.
Witherspoon, who spent most of her waking hours
with her bed curtains drawn and upon a bed-pan,
peeked out from between the curtains. She leaned
too far, and then exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lan&rsquo; sakes, nurse! Nurse, come quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kexter vanished behind the curtains and
Miss Kerr stood stiffly looking out of the window,
and Miss Standish placed her suitcase upon the
assigned bed and prepared to open it, but footsteps
... male footsteps ... were coming up the corridor,
so she hesitated. Dr. Mattus spoke before he
was in the ward. In fact he began speaking when
he saw Miss Standish standing by the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! How are you feeling? Any weaker? You
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
are not to sleep in that bed. I want you by the window.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he saw Miss Kerr, and smiled. That smile
always saved him verbal battles. It was delivered
straightforward and deep into the eyes of the
avenging female, whatever her age. Miss Kerr
moistened her lips and prepared to resist it, but
Miss Kexter had returned from Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s
disaster and Dr. Mattus turned to her
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please get Miss Standish undressed immediately,
I want to do a physical upon her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can undress myself, Dr. Mattus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot. Until we can definitely locate your
area, the more rest, the better. Remember that,
young lady, and be a good patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He smiled at her ... and she returned it ...
and Miss Kerr went down the corridor and into the
medicine closet door.</p>
<p>Dr. Mattus went for his stethoscope, Miss Kexter
went to an insistent telephone and Rose Standish
drew the curtains and undressed. Then she
folded her best pink rayon panties and undershirt,
her chiffon stockings and silk blouse with the rose-point
and her plain suit and put them into the
small suitcase. On top she placed her hat and patent
leather pumps. She put her hairbrush ... the
ivory one with heavy bristles which Tony had given
her (he had bought it with five dollars an Italian
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
pressed upon him when he delivered the man&rsquo;s wife
in externe-obstetrics) ... onto the bedside table
and laid her tooth brush and paste beside it.</p>
<p>She re-opened the suitcase and took from a
pocket in the top the same volume of Elizabeth
Barrett Browning&rsquo;s &ldquo;Sonnets from the Portuguese&rdquo;
she had been reading at luncheon.</p>
<p>She put her purse in the bedside table, closed the
suitcase, dropped her black satin bedroom slippers
from her feet, slipped off her black rayon kimona
and got into bed.</p>
<p>She wore her only silk nightgown and it felt
soothing upon her small round breasts. It caressed
her thighs. She opened her book, pulled back the
curtains and began to read.</p>
<p>A student nurse came on the floor and took the
suitcase and brought the bed-pan for a specimen.
Then she asked if there was anything else, and
went away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Witherspoon, who had completed her operations
for the moment, emerged from her curtains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evin&rsquo;, dearie. Hope you feelin&rsquo; fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thank you. How are you feeling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better, dearie. You don&rsquo;t remember me, do
you?&rdquo; Her small murky eyes fastened themselves
upon Rose&rsquo;s near cheek.</p>
<p>Rose laid down her book and smiled at her kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m sorry, but I am afraid I do not remember.
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
I&rsquo;ve been sick and tired and my memory isn&rsquo;t
very good, Mrs....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Witherspoon, honey. I come through the accident
room a week ago comin&rsquo; Sunday. My insulatin&rsquo;
was low. Too much sugar you know, honey ...
and you was so kin&rsquo;. I could scarce speak and you
was so kin&rsquo;. I&rsquo;ll never forgit how kin&rsquo; you was,
showin&rsquo; me the labatory, an&rsquo; all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You done me so nice that I thinks I ought to
tell you, dearie, &rsquo;bout thet bed. Three people ...
countin&rsquo; the one ... <i>they</i> seys was operated on
... and Miss Kerr knows was daid ... three
patients done died in thet bed sence Thursday.
Miss Frisby, an awful nice girl with a goitre, and
Mrs. Overlea ... she was a heart attacker ...
and then last night, Miss Tuck. It looks suspicious,
I seys. If I was you, dearie....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was interrupted by the reappearance of Dr.
Mattus and Dr. Sarah James. They pulled the
curtains to Miss Standish&rsquo;s bed and Mrs. Witherspoon
tucked her chins into her breasts and went
back to her crocheting.</p>
<p>Rose Standish noticed her feet felt like icicles.</p>
<p>When their examination was over she was frightened.
You could not go over any human being that
thoroughly without finding something wrong, and
her nurse&rsquo;s disdain for a person who allowed herself
to get sick disturbed her considerably. Suppose
they really did find something and kept her in
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
bed here a month? A lot more than she had bargained
for ... that!</p>
<p>Mrs. Witherspoon laid down her crocheting and
peered at the little nurse&rsquo;s pale face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did you up kinda bad, dearie. All them
blood tests and things. Severe I calls it. A body
can&rsquo;t even keep her corns nowadays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose Standish laughed in spite of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I didn&rsquo;t mind. A nurse gets used to things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckin&rsquo; you right. I reckin&rsquo; you right. It&rsquo;s
pow&rsquo;ful sad the amount a body can put up with,
whin you is used to it. Take me, dearie. I had eleven
children. Four breeches presentations, three feet,
three dry, and one nat&rsquo;rul. And would you believe
it, the nat&rsquo;rul was the wors&rsquo;! It lef&rsquo; me kinda flat fo&rsquo;
months. A body gits prepared to put up wid things
... thet hurts ... now things like this sugar
business ... no pain, nor nuthin&rsquo; ... you can&rsquo;t
get resisted fur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Relaxation, Mrs. Witherspoon, is the best
weapon with which to fight disease. I&rsquo;m tired. I
think I&rsquo;ll take a nap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you good, dearie. Excitement and all, and
then puttin&rsquo; you in thet bed, too. Death-beds is
weakenin&rsquo;. It takes a sunnin&rsquo; every day and a good
six months to make a mattress lose a death struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose Standish turned her face to the window and
closed her eyes, and shivered. &ldquo;Lose your heart,
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
lose your appendix, lose anything, but don&rsquo;t lose
your nerves,&rdquo; was what Tony always said.</p>
<p>Ridiculous to be feeling like this. Crazy. Perhaps
if she tried to think about something else, then
her feet would quit perspiring. Think about the
way Dr. MacArthur had looked when she offered
to come ... Galsworthy said that your mouth
was what you had become but your eyes were what
you were.... Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s eyes were like
wave crests against a blue, blue sky. Clean and
deep and clear, when he had turned them into her,
stood up, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done more for me in fifteen minutes
than anybody in the hospital has ever done. You
have picked me out of despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began to tremble again and then she realized
that it was the way he had looked when he said it
that made her tremble. That look was the grandest
thing that had happened to her since Tony kissed
her the day he died.</p>
<p>Of course she must expect to be jumpy, to feel
fidgetty, to get dry in the throat; good heavens,
all of that was perfectly natural under the circumstances!
Dr. MacArthur had even told her to expect
it, and he had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you get scared, shift your mind to something
else. You are like a doctor observing an operation,
you are like an important actress watching a
play of which she knows all of the lines being enacted
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
by amateurs. Remember what you used to do
as a student nurse and see,&rdquo; and then he smiled
wryly, &ldquo;if the routine has changed one second&rsquo;s
worth. I bet it hasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and felt better. She looked
at her watch and found it was four forty-five.
Time to bring the patients in off the porch and prepare
for supper. Behind her she heard a voice and
turned over. The woman, whose bed stood next to
Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s, had been rolled into place already!</p>
<p>She was as insignificant as a dried corn stalk.
Heart case probably. That queer revived look a
wilted flower has when you stick the stem in hot
aspirin water. She was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The air was swell! It&rsquo;s comin&rsquo; on cool and &rsquo;pears
like we may get a thunder shower by bed-time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Across from Rose Standish&rsquo;s bed had been rolled
that of a tremendously fat woman. Some sort of
thyroid insufficiency. The outlines of her obese legs
were visible under the sheets. Rose shivered. Nice
job bathing a hog like that. She had seen one in
the accident room last winter with secondary burns.
Fat, layers and layers and layers. Awful to operate
upon!</p>
<p>The woman smiled at her and began speaking:</p>
<p>&ldquo;New?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Miss Standish,&rdquo; Mrs. Witherspoon supplied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>Rose bowed politely.</p>
<p>The fat woman whispered loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I seen her, Mrs. With&rsquo;spoon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seen ... Her...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is &lsquo;Her&rsquo;?&rdquo; Rose asked.</p>
<p>The fat woman toppled with knowledge. Mrs.
Witherspoon snatched the words from her parting
lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patient in Room Two. They say she was
hurt in a bus acci-dent. But thet was Thursday,
an&rsquo; she ain&rsquo;t daid yit. The windie shade is always
drawed and the nurses acts like she ain&rsquo;t no sicker
then the rest....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s awful prutty,&rdquo; the fat woman tried to
interrupt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Witherspoon continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Callin&rsquo; thim dyin&rsquo; patient rooms an&rsquo; puttin&rsquo;
thim &rsquo;tween the ward an&rsquo; the porch! I ain&rsquo;t no
hosbittle fixer, but it &rsquo;pears to me, I&rsquo;d a put &rsquo;em
closen onto the nurse&rsquo;s dest....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose Standish laughed softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a dying patient, Mrs. Witherspoon, the
Head Nursing Office sends a general duty nurse
to do &lsquo;special charting&rsquo;. So dying patients have
private nurses. It doesn&rsquo;t matter where the rooms
are.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
<p>&ldquo;She ain&rsquo;t got no privett nurse!&rdquo; the heavy
woman hissed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps the hospital was full and they put her
there when she came in and can&rsquo;t risk moving her.
Have you been here long?&rdquo; Rose said.</p>
<p>The woman lifted her pendulous breasts and
swung them out from the body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew! Hot today! Three weeks goin&rsquo; on Monday,
mam. Long enough to know thet I wouldn&rsquo;t
sleep in thet bed, you is in, not for a million dollars.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with it?&rdquo; Rose inquired
demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s ... it&rsquo;s ...&rdquo; her breasts rested upon
her bed as she leaned forward, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a death....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Miss Kexter&rsquo;s appearance on the ward
brought her speech to a sudden halt. She flopped
her body back upon the pillows and smiled weakly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I think of all the clothes I got to wash
whin I get outa here. I prides myself my chillun
is the cleanest goin&rsquo;, and the teachers always seys
so, too. In all the health campaigns at School 17,
Willie is always chose....&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Rose Standish heard no more. Miss Kexter
was standing beside her bed and saying, &ldquo;When
did you decide to be sick?&rdquo; Miss Standish caught
the sarcastic banter in her voice and replied
lightly, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t. And I hope I aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kexter stood perplexedly by for a moment,
<span class="pb" id="Page_143">143</span>
pondering that phrase. &ldquo;I aren&rsquo;t, I am not, I
aren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she kept saying it over and over to herself.
Rose Standish had been to college. She
couldn&rsquo;t be wrong, yet that didn&rsquo;t sound right,
somehow ... &ldquo;I aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry this happened to you when the infirmary
was closed. You must hate it on a ward. Hard
as we work, I must say in spite of the depression,
I think the nurses ought to be allowed to be sick in
private, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; Rose&rsquo;s voice had taken on its
accident room clip, but the tone was conversational.
&ldquo;Came so suddenly hadn&rsquo;t thought about
it. Awful jolt in a way. Glad to be put anywhere,
just so it&rsquo;s the Elijah Wilson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you find it out?&rdquo; Miss Kexter&rsquo;s
voice had lost the skepticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know. Been running an afternoon
temperature, and then yesterday I spit a little
blood, so I went to Dr. Cub Sterling.&rdquo; She shrugged
her shoulders despairingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a shame.&rdquo; Miss Kexter&rsquo;s voice, like her
face, was shallow and flat. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mind that
bed, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose&rsquo;s &ldquo;No. Why?&rdquo; was casual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing. Just that three patients went out
in it this week and they put us on the spot about
it.&rdquo; She had leaned forward and her whisper was
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
flat, also. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been holy hell around here.
They were all patients of Father and Son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody know what killed them?&rdquo; Rose&rsquo;s
voice was curiously inquiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Angels, darling. How the hell should I
know? Even &lsquo;Foots&rsquo; hasn&rsquo;t seen their charts since
autopsy and is she mad? &rsquo;Bout to bust a brassiere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose Standish laughed in spite of herself. The
thought of Miss Roenna Kerr bursting a brassiere
fitted in perfectly with her own suppressed
hysteria.</p>
<p>Her laugh was high and thin and flutelike. It
saved her tears. It cleared her system. All of her
accumulating fear escaped into it.</p>
<p>Miss Kexter&rsquo;s common face expanded into a
grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Standish,&rdquo; she begged, &ldquo;or <i>you&rsquo;ll</i>
bust a lung.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose didn&rsquo;t wait to simmer down. She hushed
immediately. She had, for the moment, forgotten
she was ill.</p>
<p>The woman with the pendulous breasts swayed
forward and said, &ldquo;Let a fellow in on the joke,
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s raucous voice demanded,
&ldquo;Tend to me, Miss Kexter. A pan, quick!&rdquo;
And as she ran from the ward Miss Kexter turned
and ordered, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk to Miss Standish, now.
She&rsquo;s got to be quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">145</div>
<p>Rose turned upon her side and looked out of
the window. She put her thin little face against
her flattened hands and lay completely still. That
laugh had made her realize how tired she really
was, and how silly she had been to let the superstitions
of these women frighten her. What she needed
was a nap and then she&rsquo;d be all right. She closed
her lovely eyes and snuggled into the pillows.</p>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t coming to the ward that had made
her so awfully tired, but remembering all ... all
everything ... about Tony again. For two
years, now, she had taught her mind to close up as
suddenly as a four-o&rsquo;clock when she began to remember.
Remembering was no good, it only made
you ache in your back and sting behind your eyes.</p>
<p>Still if she was afraid again, it wouldn&rsquo;t hurt
to make believe. Make believe, as she used to do
when she first knew Tony and wished she could
get sick and nearly die and have pneumonia, and
heart trouble and ... and then she smiled to herself
at the funny child she had been. If she had
ever come down with a combination of any two of
the diseases she had desired in trios and quartettes,
she would have never recovered ... and the object
of those imaginary illnesses had always been
to get well and marry Tony!</p>
<p>She was aroused from her reverie by a student
nurse saying, &ldquo;Miss Standish, are you ready to
wash? Here&rsquo;s your basin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">146</div>
<p>She looked at her watch and smiled at the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right on time, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl laughed merrily.</p>
<p>Rose threw her head to one side and inquired,
&ldquo;And supper will be along in a minute?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mam. I&rsquo;m going to begin bringing it in,
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose sat erect and wrung her wash cloth out
and ran it over her small face. The water felt good.
She wrung it again and laid it behind her ears.
That felt good, too. She took a small comb from
her hand bag and slid it through her short black
hair. Then she wrung the cloth out carefully,
folded it as she had been taught to do when a pupil
nurse, and brushed her teeth into the basin.</p>
<p>This was nice. It was fun being in bed in a ward
of perfectly strange women, rather than in a stuffy
infirmary with six or seven nurses talking shop
and telling jokes all the time. She looked down the
ward at the rows of beds, and the glass partition
which separated them from the other fourteen beds;
at the place where the partition stopped in the
center of the ward to create an aisle and then at
the white beds beyond. Through the far windows
was a perfectly glorious sunset, and out of her
own window just the feathery beginning of new
leaves upon an old tree.</p>
<p>She had never seen the ward from this angle.
It was really a very pretty sight, when viewed
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
from bed and with nothing to do. Perhaps it was
because she had been through so much emotionally
today that it looked especially pretty. Things did,
after such days.</p>
<p>Or perhaps it was because she wasn&rsquo;t rushing
to get everything in order before the duty changes,
rushing to remember this and do that. For once
her day was ending with the sun&rsquo;s setting.</p>
<p>It was a good feeling. She stretched her toes and
the covers swelled with her rising breasts. And now
in a few minutes supper would be along.</p>
<p>The ward was full of chatter, but she didn&rsquo;t hear
it. A voluptuous relaxation was upon her. In bed.
At sunset. Awaiting supper, and watching the
ugly faces of old women bloom, with the softening
light ... and the new leaves on the tree taking
on that clear green which hurt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the last in line, so I&rsquo;m a half minute
late in bringing it to you,&rdquo; the student nurse
apologized, poising her tray. &ldquo;Want to sit up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, nurse,&rdquo; Rose responded in a very helpless
voice.</p>
<p>The nurse wound up her bed, took away the
wash basin and Rose began her supper.</p>
<p>It fitted in exactly with her mood, and seemed,
at the moment, much nicer than the meals she had
in the nurses&rsquo; dining room.</p>
<p>Cream of tomato soup, and batter-bread and
liver with bacon and lots of gravy, and lettuce
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
salad with thousand island dressing, and then for
dessert stewed pears ... the only stewed fruit
she liked. How utterly lucky!</p>
<p>She began &ldquo;tasting&rdquo; and discovered that her
milk had real cream in it, too. That was sumptuous!</p>
<p>She ate with a dainty grace which captivated
Mrs. Witherspoon, who put down her soup bowl
from which she had been drinking, and announced
&ldquo;Birdlike! That&rsquo;s what you are! Set a body wondering
soon as I seen you. Lift your fork as refined
as a canary does his foot. Pleasure to watch
you at your victuals, dearie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose laughed and blushed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Ward women made you feel so nice, somehow....</p>
<p>At seven Miss Kexter and the student nurse
went off duty. They had both come to her and
asked if there was anything she specially wanted
before they left. But, of course, there wasn&rsquo;t, and
Miss Kexter had said, &ldquo;Please be alive in the morning,
Standish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they had both laughed.</p>
<p>After Miss Kexter had gone Mrs. Witherspoon
looked over her spectacles and announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hearn what she said, dearie. Guess you feel
like the clown who was sick and the doc said, &lsquo;See
you in the morning,&rsquo; and the clown seys, &lsquo;Sure you
will, doc, but will I see you?&rsquo; Brave, them circus
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
people. An&rsquo; loyal, my soul! They are paying for
you, ain&rsquo;t they, Woodsie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned to the shrivelled woman with the bad
heart. The woman&rsquo;s face outshone the sunset.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Payin&rsquo; my pension like I done for many a
trouper before me. Circus folks never let each other
down. Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did you travel with?&rdquo; Rose, who had been
&ldquo;letting her supper down,&rdquo; a new and delightful
experience, turned and asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I done the back somersault in Barnum and
Bailey&rsquo;s up to 1906. Then I fell ... I ain&rsquo;t ever
known how, but the ringmaster seys the horse
slipped ... in Minneapolis that August ...
and I ain&rsquo;t ever been right since.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have had a wonderful sense of balance
and courage.&rdquo; Rose&rsquo;s voice carried awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you ain&rsquo;t got guts you&rsquo;d better stay outa
circuses, and nursing, too, I guess.&rdquo; The woman&rsquo;s
voice had a note of admiration.</p>
<p>The two student nurses who had the seven to
nine duty began preparing the ward for the night.
One brought around the bed-pans and tooth-mugs.
Mrs. Witherspoon, and the woman who had been
a bareback rider, extracted their teeth and placed
them in their mugs.</p>
<p>The other nurse came around with the thermometers
and started counting pulses.</p>
<p>The conversation ceased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
<p>Rose Standish put forward her wrist for the
child to count her pulse. How young this pupil
nurse looked. How young and frightened!</p>
<p>She was trying to think of something to say to
her when the negroes on the floor above began
singing. Through the melody of their voices ...
she had been in the accident room so long, she had
forgotten about their singing after supper, she
lost touch with the student nurse. A high soprano
fluted: &ldquo;Swing lo ... o ... Sweet Char ...
ee ... ot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And suddenly she knew their plaintive harmony,
the admiration of the patients, the sense of work
ceasing with the day, had left her tremendously
happy and glad to be here. Glad she was part of
the Elijah Wilson! And she was part of it! Dr.
MacArthur had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are planning to enlarge the accident room.
You are the first person I have told about it. And
while you are lying in that bed, I want you to
decide what changes you think it would be wise to
make. You can be a great help to me, if you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great help ... and every head nurse in the
hospital would give her eyebrows to have him say
that to her! As soon as the ward quieted down,
she&rsquo;d have to begin to think about it ... or perhaps
it might be best to wait until tomorrow and
let the singing of the negroes lull her to sleep.</p>
<p>She wasn&rsquo;t afraid any more. And anyhow Dr.
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
MacArthur had said, so far as evidence was concerned,
she had nothing to be afraid of, except
hypodermics, and she would like to see the person
who could give her a hypo now! She would like to
see two people try to give her....</p>
<p>Down the corridor she caught a glimpse of Dr.
Ethridge Sterling, Senior, and Dr. Sterling. Was
Dr. Bear shrinking or did he just look so little and
chubby because he was walking beside Dr. Cub?
They both looked worried; when they entered the
ward, they were smiling.</p>
<p>Their arrival created a nervous tension just the
same. A sense of dread filled the air. Dr. Sterling
began doing his rounds and talking briskly to his
father about each patient. But Dr. Bear put his
famous hands firmly across his back and looked
solid. Rose Standish frowned. He looked just that
way when a bad accident came in. Like it hurt
him ... all over ... too.</p>
<p>Finally they reached her bed and Dr. Sterling
barked, &ldquo;Good evening, Miss Standish. Want
Father to look you over. This condition sometimes
comes from effusion and is operative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The student nurse hovering in the background
ran for the instrument basket, and Dr. Sterling
began drawing the bed curtains.</p>
<p>Dr. Bear was already leaning over and looking
straight into her eyes with his measuring ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<p>Her bloodless lips turned a pinkish red. They
accentuated the ivory pallor of her peaked face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, thank you. But if I get examined
many more times, you are bound to find something
wrong, somewhere. How are you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was fun to be talking to Dr. Bear this way.
He was accepting her as an equal, sort of....</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired. Did two bad carcinomas this morning.
Breasts. Two ruptured appendices, and a gall-bladder,
and I&rsquo;ve a cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why not wait and go over me in the morning,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I&rsquo;m the parent of an electric dynamo,&rdquo;
he growled and the nurse and Dr. Sterling, Junior,
reappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you waiting for?&rdquo; Dr. Bear frowned
at the pupil nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hand you what you want, sir.&rdquo; she replied
woodenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t. What I want is rest. My son will
hand me what I need. You go back to the ward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nurse backed out hesitantly. Miss Kerr had
said every nurse in the building must permit no
doctor to approach any patient without being
present all of the time ... but ... but....</p>
<p>Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Nurse! Tend to me....&rdquo;
and then &ldquo;Hurry, nurse!&rdquo; sent the girl running.</p>
<p>Dr. Bear put his stethoscope carefully to his
ears and listened to Rose Standish&rsquo;s chest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do everything you ought to. Don&rsquo;t make me
ask you,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>She inflated, deflated, said &ldquo;A ... A ... A....&rdquo;
held her breath, turned so that he could
listen through her back. Repeated it all for Dr.
Sterling, Junior, who listened carefully to her
heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mmmmm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Bear winked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Two physicians at the oar will row you to the
Stygian shore,&rsquo;&rdquo; he quoted.</p>
<p>Miss Standish laughed, and Dr. Cub Sterling
gave both of them a harassed stare. They sobered
obediently.</p>
<p>The examination was thorough, painstaking and
consumed almost half an hour. At its conclusion
Dr. Sterling, Junior, said a very clipped, &ldquo;Thank
you, Miss Standish,&rdquo; and vanished. And Rose knew
how deeply grateful he was, really.</p>
<p>His father lingered long enough to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll explode some day. Thank you, my dear.
Thank you very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her thin little hand in his capable one
and growled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are nervous, aren&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m going to tell
Mattus to give you a bromide, if you need it.&rdquo; And
then he squeezed her hand gratefully and uttered,
for the edification of the ward, a very professional,
&ldquo;Good night, Miss Standish.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her reply was professional, but she put her
hand under the cover and squeezed it herself.</p>
<p>Dr. Bear was a darling. It had been sweet the
way he had explained Dr. Sterling&rsquo;s attitude and
then thanked her himself.</p>
<p>When this was all over, how many real friends
she would have gained. But she mustn&rsquo;t forget that
she was here for a purpose. Perhaps if she took a
short nap now, she would be in better trim for the
real thing ... if it came....</p>
<p>She turned over and tried to sleep, but the tension
on the ward was so overpowering that she thought
perhaps if she entered the conversation she might
discover ... or maybe she was just imagining
things and the thunderstorm which was brewing
was causing that feeling.</p>
<p>If only they would all begin to talk of something
they were interested in and not to cover up what
they were thinking.</p>
<p>There came a lull and she asked Mrs. Witherspoon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think the flavor is better when you cook
pork with sauerkraut, or without it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without it!&rdquo; chimed in the woman with the
enormous legs. &ldquo;I give it to my children since they
was babies and I always cooks it thorough ...
four to five hours ... and then....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do?&rdquo; Mrs. Witherspoon laid down her
<span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
crocheting, inserted her teeth and became emphatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thet saps all the taste. Mr. Witherspoon likes
hisn so ez the pork and kraut is mixed flavored, if
you know what I mean. Ain&rsquo;t it awful leathery,
yo&rsquo; way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t the cookin&rsquo; time, as I was about to say,&rdquo;
the fat woman drew up her chins, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the <i>cookin&rsquo;</i>
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got one of them steamer cookeths. It doz
gran&rsquo;,&rdquo; lisped the ex-circus woman.</p>
<p>Mrs. Witherspoon gave her a frivolous glance,
and replied positively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nuthin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout workin&rsquo; them new
fangled things. But I&rsquo;ve et from them. Eddie May,
Sammy&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; both of her listeners nodded, &ldquo;the
one what come to see me Satd&rsquo;y has one. And Mr.
Witherspoon seys after we went to Sammy&rsquo;s Easter
dinner, &lsquo;Jennie, the only way to cook victuals is
to cook &rsquo;em with the eye. Baste &rsquo;em, and taste &rsquo;em,
and it&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; like stokin&rsquo; an ingine,&rsquo; he seys, &lsquo;you
got to keep yo&rsquo; eye to it.&rsquo; If you know what I
mean....&rdquo;</p>
<p>This precipitated a hot argument upon washing
machines, with the fat woman as the defendant.
So Rose Standish shifted her attention to the
clouds. If the women kept up for fifteen minutes
more ... and if she knew wards they were good
for hours ... the thunderstorm would be here,
and they would be quieted down for the night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<p>She looked at her watch. It was almost nine.
Time for the night nurse to be coming along, in
just a few minutes. And while she was waiting for
her to come and bed the ward down, she might as
well begin to think about the accident room.</p>
<p>Those scrub-up basins should be moved across
the room and as far away as possible from the door
in which the accidents were brought. And then, too,
some arrangement should be made to equalize the
lighting over the two tables. And also to give the
nurse at the instrument table enough light to see
what she was handing. And in some of the badly
mangled cases, it would quicken things considerably
if a passageway was built directly into the
elevator corridor, so that they might be hurried
up to the operating room.</p>
<p>Then, of course it was a little thing, but awfully
important nervously: the girl who took the doctors&rsquo;
dictation onto the typewriter ought to have a
noiseless machine. And it would be terribly hard
to convince the Superintendent of Nurses, but she
was going to tell Dr. MacArthur that she needed
another student nurse on duty there. After a football
game or a big race meet when the automobile
accidents began to pour in, it was frightful. There
was nobody, except the girl at the typewriter who
couldn&rsquo;t stop, whose hands were not all gory and
spotted every paper they touched.</p>
<p>She was distracted by a flash of lightning, Mrs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
Witherspoon&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Lan&rsquo; sake, nurse, I&rsquo;ve wet my
bed,&rdquo; and Miss Kerr&rsquo;s niece, the night student
nurse leaning over her and purring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Standish, are you better? Here&rsquo;s your
thermometer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps it was her voice coming so soon after
the flash, but there seemed something too saccharin
in its tone to Rose Standish. She shivered before
she turned to take the extended thermometer.</p>
<p>Of course she knew Miss Kerr&rsquo;s niece was the
night student nurse they were watching, but somehow
she didn&rsquo;t associate the name and the girl.
She had never liked this girl when she had been
in the accident room. No real heart, and stubborn
and cattish ... and then her eyes were too close
together....</p>
<p>With barely a fleeting smile, Miss Kerr thrust
the thermometer into Miss Standish&rsquo;s hand and
ran to close the windows. It had begun to rain.</p>
<p>While the windows were being closed Bessie Ellis,
the child down the ward who had received the toy
in the night, began crying in her sleep. She had
been disturbed by the lightning, and her moans
made the women shivery.</p>
<p>Several of the women called out to her and Mrs.
Witherspoon&rsquo;s lisping (her teeth again removed),
&ldquo;Alwite bavvy, don cwy,&rdquo; struck Miss Standish as
highly amusing. She slipped her thermometer
around and laughed. Miss Kerr, the student nurse,
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
flopped down the last window and went to the
moaning child.</p>
<p>While she was walking down the ward there came
another flash of lightning, a sudden hissing, and
the lights went out. It was followed by a panicky
silence and then the hysterical laughter of Mrs.
Witherspoon.</p>
<p>Rose Standish ducked as if she had been hit, and
as she ducked something began choking her about
the neck. She spit her thermometer upon the bed
and began tugging at the horrible pulling. A thing,
like a brick, hit her upon the head as she tried to
sit up, and she thought, &ldquo;it can&rsquo;t be the murderer,
he only uses hypodermics,&rdquo; and the lights went up,
while Mrs. Witherspoon was still laughing, and
she saw Miss Kerr standing between their beds,
and reaching for her thermometer.</p>
<p>In a moment she understood that the sash of
her kimona had become twisted about her neck,
and it was the book she had been reading and stuck
upon the edge of her pillow which had fallen ...
and it was all absurd. All, that is, except the look
in Miss Kerr&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>The surprised look, when she saw Miss Standish
was still alive! Her tongue was so dry she couldn&rsquo;t
speak and a horrible nausea began rising within
her, but Mrs. Witherspoon drew the girl&rsquo;s evil
eyes when she demanded that her bed be fixed <i>now</i>.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr went for the sheets and Miss Standish
<span class="pb" id="Page_159">159</span>
lay down and turned her face toward the window
and tried to forget it all. She placed one of her
thin hands at the base of her brain and began
massaging her neck. This was no way to do. Get
frightened at a little thing like a book hitting you.
A person who lost her nerve over such things
wasn&rsquo;t fit to look for mice in a dark pantry let
alone clear the reputation of Dr. Cub Sterling and
solve the terror of the Elijah Wilson. Forget it
all for a few minutes and remember the routine a
student nurse should be following, now.</p>
<p>Of course the changing of Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s
bed was throwing everything slightly behind time,
but that should be finished in a minute, and she
turned over to watch the girl make the bed. Her
technique was excellent and she was a swift worker.
Seemed sure of herself.</p>
<p>Even from the back, Rose knew she didn&rsquo;t like
her. And never would. Miss Kerr turned to finish
the pulses. Then she began taking the flowers out
of the ward for the night. She took the pink roses
which the clowns had sent to the circus woman,
and the nasturtiums the children had brought the
fat woman, and Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s tube rose ...
thank goodness ... and then she came back and
gave out the final round of bed-pans, the final
glasses of water, and went for her medicine tray.</p>
<p>The little girl had gone back to sleep, but down
the ward a gray old woman, whose face was like
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
cracked rock, was breathing with the horrible labor
of a heart attack. Rose Standish started to call
the student nurse and tell her to get Mattus right
away, and then she decided that it was about time
she began to remember that she was a patient on
the ward and not a nurse.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr returned with the medicine tray. She
gave Mrs. Witherspoon her hypodermic, and almost
as a sponge does water, the withered body
soaked it up, and she fell into a deep slumber. The
woman with the thyroid insufficiency had her sleeping
potion and began the long slow breathing of a
laboring body.</p>
<p>The rain had broken the tension and the women
were drifting off before the lights were dimmed. It,
with the aid of the drugs, of course, was soothing
and lulling them into oblivion. The long, slow torrents
fell in strips outside the window and drowned
out the labored breathing of the woman with the
heart attack.</p>
<p>Rose lay perfectly still, so still she was almost
drifting herself. Miss Kerr had reached the bed
in which the heart patient lay and at last realized
her condition ... a tuned ear could have noted
it down the corridor ... she turned and walked
prissily off the ward ... not hurrying, and with
her hips flat ... and called Dr. Mattus. Rose
could hear her cooing out the dying woman&rsquo;s condition,
and gathered that he was coming up.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>In a few minutes he appeared and after a quick
glance began pumping digitalis into her ...
Rose could have told the nurse to do that! Then
when she rallied, and after the lights had been
dimmed, he came by her bed and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Miss Standish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took her pulse and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heart you&rsquo;ve got. Dr. Sterling, Senior,
said you could have a sedative if you buckle. Ring
for it, if you want it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;ll it be, doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crinkled his long nose and sniffed, &ldquo;Poison!
Little nurses mustn&rsquo;t ask big questions! &rsquo;Night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His smile was broad, and forced.</p>
<p>By ten ... Rose looked at her radio-light
watch ... the ward had &ldquo;bedded down&rdquo; and the
rain had diminished to occasional drippings. Everything
was cool and still. Miss Kerr had settled
down to doing her fever charts at the desk. Occasionally,
she turned and peered into the darkened
ward, and Rose felt her looking at her bed, inquiringly.</p>
<p>She lay on her back, stretched her legs, put her
arms at her sides, little girl fashion, and began to
breathe deeply. Perhaps if she did that for thirty
counts, she would drift off to sleep. If she buckled.
... she&rsquo;d show &rsquo;em. Begin to get some rest ...
plenty of it ... it had been a long day ... a
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
trying evening ... now everything was peaceful
and everybody was beginning to sleep.</p>
<p>But if she dared to go to sleep, why couldn&rsquo;t the
person ... whoever it was ... come while she
was asleep and ... and....</p>
<p>She reached for her glass of water and took a
drink. Her lips were so dry it hurt to open them.
This was foolish. How was her heart doing? She
took her pulse and discovered it was 106. Perhaps
she had better have a potion after all.</p>
<p>She looked toward the desk. Miss Kerr wasn&rsquo;t
there!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<h2 id="c6">&raquo;VI&laquo;
<br />The Second Doll</h2>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock Dr. Harrison entered
the hospital through the accident room door
and started up the main corridor. The last of the
nurses and internes were returning from breakfast,
the morning sun as they passed the occasional windows
was picking each face out of its oblivion and
then throwing it back again.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison shivered. The faces looked as the
faces did upon the streets of every city in the
United States the morning after the Lindbergh
baby had been found....</p>
<p>The cynically young, the frightened vacant, the
intelligent, the eager, the stupid, all reflected the
knowledge that Rose Standish was dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nurse died last night,&rdquo; the stupid faces, the
childish faces, the vacant faces reflected, and as
the intelligence increased, the horror in the eyes
grew....</p>
<p>Upon the internes and residents they showed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A nurse was murdered last night.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
<p>And with an increasing frequency he saw eyes
which knew:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was murdered in Cub Sterling&rsquo;s Clinic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He passed the entrance to his own clinic, and
then retraced his footsteps. His duty was to MacArthur,
but his first duty was to suppress as much
staff hysteria as possible. With the staff in such
a condition, it was only a question of hours before
the patients, all over the hospital....</p>
<p>His resident was standing beside the elevator
upon the first floor. He turned and Dr. Harrison
noted the first, second, and then a third horror in
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Morning, Wheeler,&rdquo; his voice was calm and
measured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Doctor Harrison. Do you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About the nurse? I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. About Doctor Bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison turned his searching brown eyes
into the man&rsquo;s gray ones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The resident met the glance and responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pneumonia. Bilateral. Cub is with him. Diagnosis
confirmed. Brought him into hospital on a
stretcher about two hours ago. He&rsquo;s in Medicine
Clinic now ... hopeless....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison staggered for the first time in his
medical life.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<p>&ldquo;They murdered him! The dogs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned from the elevator and walked out of
his clinic and down the corridor toward the Medicine
Clinic. He walked calmly, like a man going to
his execution and convinced of his innocence....
That heart attack was responsible, as sure as death
itself, Hoffbein, Peters and Paton had killed ...
his best, his very best friend....</p>
<p>His agony was so acute that the passing faces
with their increasing hysteria seemed natural.</p>
<p class="tb">Turning to Mattus, Cub Sterling said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better look in on Miss Merriweather, in case
her father telephones today. Then you can find me
with Dr. Sterling, if you need me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned from Ward B and walked into Room
Two and closed the door. That shade onto the
Ward was still lowered. He had lowered it himself
the first night he brought the cigarettes.</p>
<p>He and Sally Ferguson were completely alone.</p>
<p>She was smoking a cigarette. The room swam
with pinking air and Cub leaned against the door
jam and snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the leg since they took the bandages
off? All right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ignored the question and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just woke up! Why did you give me those
pills last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He walked toward the bed, and the horror of
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
the night receded and a wild happiness suffused
his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know, Salscie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To make me ... sleep?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have slept ... without...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned over her and kissed her twice. Completely
and reachingly.</p>
<p>She burrowed her head between his collar and
his neck and whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid the weight of his head upon hers and
she moaned and brought her lips within reach
again.</p>
<p>Cub drained them a third time and tucking his
head between her breasts said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God I need that, darling! I&rsquo;ve been through
hell ... hell ... red hot hell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he jerked his head up and bored his eyes
into hers. His voice was wild and heavy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever happens, whatever anybody tells
you, whatever comes ... you must promise me,
Salscie, that you&rsquo;ll believe in me ... that you&rsquo;ll
trust me ... and know that I&rsquo;ve wanted you all
my life ... and when all of this works out ...
I&rsquo;m going to ... live with you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her body stiffened and she snatched her eyes
out of his. Her voice was hard and narrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub Sterling, I wouldn&rsquo;t ... ever ... live
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
with you! At last I see why women have children
... why they want to belong....&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the angularity went out of him. He reached
over and gathered her into his arms. His voice
curled and nestled in her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have them, Salscie! Lots of little Sterlings!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the loud speaker began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Docterr Ste-earling, Junyior, Doct-terr Eth-err-ridge
Ste-arling, Junyior. Calling Doct-terr....&rdquo;</p>
<p>They wilted apart, but their eyes still held and
Cub said, softly and definitely:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s ill. Very ill. The hospital&rsquo;s in a
terrible stew. I may not get to see you for a couple
of days. Be good until I do! Take care of yourself!
Don&rsquo;t be ferocious to anybody, Salscie! Promise?
I&rsquo;ll tell Mattus to let you have your clothes, and
try sitting up if you like. Think you&rsquo;ll need some
more pills tonight ... darling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She blushed and smiled slowly. Cub took a box
from his pocket and gave her two veronal tablets.</p>
<p>Then he leaned over and ordered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiss me quick, Salscie! Sophie&rsquo;d better kiss
me, too!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the door he turned and barked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Remember! This place is full of tales....
Trust me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till death us do part, Cub darling!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>Dr. Henry MacArthur sat at his desk and
awaited the arrival of the staff. He sat perfectly
erect, dreadfully calm, with the hopeless heroism
of the stone blind. His hands were relaxed upon his
knees. Lifting them to cradle his head would require
such an enormous effort ... mentally and
physically....</p>
<p>He was as changed from the man who had lain
in bed two nights before and enjoyed scotch highballs
as if he had spent twenty years in Siberia.
The hair at the temples looked grayer and the face
was marble in its emotions. They came separately,
and filled its furrows. Bitter self recrimination. He
had sent a perfectly innocent woman to her death.
A mere child. He had allowed her to go up, pass
through hell and die ... for his honor, Cub
Sterling&rsquo;s reputation, and the Elijah Wilson Hospital.
And to die so uselessly, so bravely, so quietly.</p>
<p>And the self-recrimination was followed by a
nobility which made him beautiful, as the world
thought King Albert beautiful while he was bleeding
over Belgium.</p>
<p>Bleeding over the tremendous heroism of human
beings. Over the cool straight bravery of
quiet people. Over the fragile littleness of her still
body. Over the sense of still living that her small
ivory face had held when he and Cub Sterling and
Dr. Bear&rsquo;s assistant were leaning over her body,
under the glaring light of that autopsy table.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>It had been like bending over a plucked magnolia
blossom, on a summer morning. There was a
spiritual fragrance about her as poignant as the
perfume of magnolias. A feeling of sheer beauty,
wasted....</p>
<p>If he lived to be a hundred, he would never forget
the exquisite curve of that child&rsquo;s small rounded
breast and the nauseating sense of having stuck
a knife in it, which came over him!</p>
<p>An Edith Cavell, a Florence Nightingale, a
Jeanne d&rsquo;Arc, and he had stood in her presence
alive ... and dead....</p>
<p>And all of it had been so futile. But as certain
as death itself was the knowledge ... within his
own mind ... that Cub Sterling had had nothing
to do with it. That Cub Sterling could not have
stood beside him in that autopsy room a few scant
hours ago and the sense of horror and helplessness
have so entirely gripped them. And it did grip ...
both of them.</p>
<p>He started to telephone for Cub to come to him
now and then he remembered about Bear, and his
head ... for the first time since he had been
Director of the Elijah Wilson Hospital ... fell
into his cupped hands, while the door into the corridor
stood wide open.</p>
<p>Caesar was dead, Napoleon was dead, Osler was
dead, Socrates was dead, Halsted was dead and
Bear Sterling was dying....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>Dying because of overwork and a bad heart.
Sacrificed to his profession by his colleagues! That
heart attack yesterday, coupled with the cold had
done it.</p>
<p>All the great men were dead or dying....
Coniine....</p>
<p>He turned over Cub Sterling&rsquo;s testimony concerning
the death of Miss Standish, and stared
vacantly at the words. Somewhere, at this very
minute, there was walking, still free, about the
Elijah Wilson Hospital, probably laughing and
talking with other patients, a nurse, a doctor ...
a man ... a woman ... a murderer....</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur rose and walked to the far window
through which the warm spring sun was shining.
He must pull himself together. His duty was
not to his emotional beliefs concerning men and
their motives. Above all things he must be fair.
His duty and theirs was to the hospital and within
the next five minutes he must get himself in such
perfect control that he could compel them to see it.</p>
<p>The opportunity of the hospital to be of benefit
to humanity for the next fifty years depended entirely
upon his ability to hold his staff together
this morning. To force these exceptionally capable
men to think calmly ... and wisely.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and allowed the sun to penetrate
through the lids. A soft spring breeze floated
in the opened window. A living, gentle breeze which
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
foretold all the wealth of future living in flowers
and fragrances; which expressed as clearly as
Chopin might have, how he felt about the small,
slim body of Rose Standish.</p>
<p>It seared him like a sirocco. Yesterday morning,
she had stood there with just such a breeze blowing.
Yesterday morning it had promised her summer,
too ... and today.... He turned his back
resolutely to the window and still stood with his
eyes closed.</p>
<p>The sun began relaxing the muscles at the base
of his brain and then he seemed suddenly sane.
Her death had been like those of the officers in the
Great War who had jumped out of the trenches
and walked up and down to give their men courage....</p>
<p>He returned to his desk and calmly began planning
what must be covered at this meeting, and
what witnesses must be called. Cub, if he could
leave his father, otherwise his testimony must suffice.
The day white nurse, the night pupil nurse,
Miss Kerr&rsquo;s niece, and Mattus&rsquo; impression of the
patient when he last saw her. Then it would be
wise to ask Dr. Heddis to come over and report
upon the autopsy findings.</p>
<p>The lack of sleep was telling upon him. He had
entirely forgotten about questioning the orderly,
William. He rang for his secretary and gave her
the orders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
<p>When Dr. Barton&rsquo;s squared frame filled the door
it brought with it a sense of relief. Queer how sane
associating with children made a man. Almost immediately
he was followed by Hoffbein, Peters and
Paton ... together. They had just settled themselves
when Dr. Harrison strode in. There was an
armor of righteousness about him that dazzled. Dr.
MacArthur had never seen Harrison this way before.
Like some great patriarch of Biblical fame
girded for battle.</p>
<p>When they were all seated, Dr. Barton and Dr.
Harrison exchanged monosyllabic diagnoses upon
Dr. Bear and Dr. MacArthur read their faces.</p>
<p>Peters, Hoffbein, and Paton missed the discussion.
They were funereal, self-righteous and pious,
respectively.</p>
<p>A nurse was dead. They had gone on record opposing
placing her in the position where she might
be murdered. Dr. MacArthur had sacrificed her to
save Cub Sterling&rsquo;s reputation.</p>
<p class="tb">At half-past six when Dr. MacArthur had notified
Dr. Peters, Dr. Peters had telephoned Dr.
Paton right away and intoned &ldquo;The sort of thing
that purifies a man,&rdquo; and after that their conversation
had been long, gossipy ... and horrified.
Princeton had been propped against his pillows,
his feet glued to a white rubber hot water bottle
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
and a deep purple corded silk dressing gown thrown
over his still firm shoulders.</p>
<p>His wife was abroad with Mrs. Paton.</p>
<p>Prissy, whose telephone was as much a part of
his bedtime equipment as his nightshirt, had lain
perfectly flat upon his bed and with their decisions
his &ldquo;seven months gone&rdquo; bay-window rose and fell.
Cushioned upon what had once been his chest was
a French telephone.</p>
<p>Their first decision had been to tell MacArthur
&ldquo;right out&rdquo; that they had to have a private meeting
without either of the Sterlings present, and
decide something.</p>
<p>As Prissy&rsquo;s upper teeth and Princeton&rsquo;s lower
ones were removed for the night, their vehemence
had seemed awfully mushy to the telephone operator
when she cut in for Paton&rsquo;s resident.</p>
<p>But when the discourse was resumed Princeton
had said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shell inten&rsquo; to shay, at the meetin&rsquo; we are
demandin&rsquo;, Paton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prissy&rsquo;s front had given a proud heave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That we cannot have our poshishun jepodized
any longer. Action&rdquo; ... the bay-window rose
... &ldquo;must be taken immediately. The powice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes had been lost over that word.
Neither of them could persuade the telephone to
accept it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
<p>&ldquo;The law to intervene,&rdquo; Princeton finally substituted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agwee entirely, Peshurs. I&rsquo;ll stan&rsquo; behin&rsquo; you,
straight through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prissy&rsquo;s offer even in the noontide sun would have
come in a high treble and over the telephone and
under the circumstances it didn&rsquo;t sound very convincing.</p>
<p>However, after they had both bathed, both felt
her death had purified them, both inserted their
teeth, both had called MacArthur and requested a
meeting minus the Sterlings.</p>
<p class="tb">It had left them a little shaky ... but now
that Dr. MacArthur was beginning to speak, Prissy
nodded to Princeton who tiptoed to the door and
closed it. They felt they had been justified in the
action they had taken.</p>
<p>Neither Sterling was present.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s voice was measured
and low, &ldquo;Rose Standish is dead. She was
murdered last night while a patient in Bed 11,
Ward B, of Medicine Clinic. An injection of coniine.
She went on that ward to save your reputation
and mine. To lift the hospital out of terror
... and she is dead, and we are....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was against it from the first,&rdquo; Princeton began
clearing himself with the rapidity of a condemned
schoolboy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>Nobody paid him the slightest attention. Prissy
blushed, and Hoffbein squirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are faced,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s blue eyes had
taken on their fighting steeliness, &ldquo;with the blackest
day the Elijah Wilson has ever seen. With the
fact that no patient anywhere is safe in any bed
of the institution ... with the responsibility of
catching a murderer within our walls. A person
who has committed two untraceable, two traceable
murders. D&rsquo;y&rsquo;see? Gentlemen, I ask your advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princeton Peters and Prissy Paton stared at
Dr. Hoffbein and he nodded ... with his eyelids,
and Princeton rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To put it plainly, straightly and to the point,
MacArthur, it is one thing to protect your professional
colleagues, but after all our Hippocratic
oath binds us <i>first</i> to the protection of our patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you called this meeting as we advised,
and have given us an opportunity of speaking
frankly. Murder, automatically, cancels loyalty!
Call in the police immediately is the advice of myself,
Dr. Paton and Dr. Hoffbein.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His peach-blossom face was brick red and it was
the fury with which Dr. Harrison rose that, at a
distance of ten feet, scared Dr. Peters into his
chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might just as well know, Dr. Peters,&rdquo; his
brown eyes were live coals, &ldquo;that this meeting was
not called without the Sterlings purposely. Barton
<span class="pb" id="Page_176">176</span>
and I were dead against it, as was MacArthur. Dr.
MacArthur was intensely kind in his opening speech
about the number of murders which have been committed
in this hospital within the last week. They
are five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, Harrison. Please stop!&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur
had risen from his chair, but he might have been
a fly upon the distant mantelpiece for the effect he
produced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry. I can&rsquo;t stop. They might just as well
know it! Call in your police! Call them in now!
And as sure as Christ was crucified I&rsquo;ll swear out
a warrant for each of you, Hoffbein, Peters and
Paton, for the murder of Bear Sterling, now dying
of pneumonia complicated by the heart attack
which you, famous colleagues and a world-renowned
psychiatrist caused by your foul insinuations yesterday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you value your international reputations
as much as your self-exhibitions in the last fifteen
years indicate, the police are out of the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get down to business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For fully four minutes after he had finished no
man in the room spoke. No man could. For fifteen,
twenty, perhaps thirty years none of them had
ever heard Dr. Harrison raise his voice above a
conversational tone, never had seen him for one-quarter
of a split second lose complete control of
<span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
himself or of a situation, never had heard him judge
a man without charity.</p>
<p>And the three he condemned were too seared to
be angry, too frightened to be resentful, too dazed
to be amazed.</p>
<p>He had spoken the truth ... and they knew it.</p>
<p>Dr. Barton, as a nurse might work upon children
upset by an explosion, took his pipe from his mouth,
and began speaking. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur, I think it is your advice that
we need, suh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing that cowed Dr. Peters, Paton and
Hoffbein, was that Dr. Harrison had suffered no
relapse. He sat firmly stroking his beard and looking
alternately at each of them.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur, his blue eyes firmly defiant,
began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hospital has never been in so delicate a
situation. I repeat that the matter must be handled
with secrecy, tact, and sanity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, gentlemen, this hospital was endowed,
it has been perpetuated for, and is famous as, a
great teaching institution. When through any
clumsiness of ours we have more beds than patients
the hospital is doomed. Its great advantage has always
been more patients than beds. D&rsquo;y&rsquo;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prissy&rsquo;s green, Princeton&rsquo;s lavender and Hoffbein&rsquo;s
liquid eyes were glued upon his face. Dr.
Barton&rsquo;s shoulders were hunched attentively.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now if we were to turn this situation over to
the police, regardless of Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s statements,
we would automatically spread into every ward of
every department, every newspaper in the country,
the superstition of every negro within a thousand
miles, the means of ruining, absolutely, your work,
mine and that of all the medical men now resident
and student here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder is a very horrible situation, but dooming
the future of at least a thousand capable men
is, in my opinion, worse, all oaths, notwithstanding.
D&rsquo;y&rsquo;see?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever hysteria is manifested must not come
from the staff, nor the blunders which so horrible an
occurrence makes us likely to fall into.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re absolutely right, Mac!&rdquo; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s
voice was placid, and Prissy and Princeton automatically
exhaled the breath they had been inhaling
preparatory to argument.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how many rabbit feet I&rsquo;ve seen
on dispensary patients in the last six months?
Sixty-three! The cancer cases love &rsquo;em. How many
patients we&rsquo;ve lost because they moved when another
negro sprinkled salt upon their doorsteps?
Eighty-one! Within three blocks of here I&rsquo;ve
counted fifteen chiropractors, ten optometrists, five
osteopaths, and seventeen midwives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superstition, witchcraft, voodoo, dynamite!
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
We&rsquo;ve <i>got</i> to keep our face no matter if all of us
are murdered. Matter with you three is just a touch
of hysteria.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoffbein squirmed and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fear psychosis is a most contagious disease, but
like all contagious diseases most debilitating. It
has only one cure: to remove the cause of the fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was precise and his words, he felt,
showed how he stood and yet were dignified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From which I understand you are suggesting
we scrap Cub Sterling,&rdquo; MacArthur&rsquo;s angry eyes
bore into him like a hot poker, and his mouth drew
to a tight line as he slapped his hand upon his
desk and stated, &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it without <i>ample</i>,
<i>complete</i> and <i>convincing evidence</i>. Have you any
to offer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hoffbein squirmed acutely and he replied evasively:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing ... tangible.... Only those small
and very personal signs which to a man in my
branch are so revealing. His hands, the hysterical
set of his left shoulder, the peculiar light which
comes into his eyes....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do!&rdquo; Dr. Harrison barked. &ldquo;If I knew
any of you had cancer, I&rsquo;d tell you so to your face.
If Bear Sterling had found any man here suffering
from an incurable brain tumor, he would have told
that man. We are not asking you for symptoms,
Hoffbein. Have you any evidence, yes or no?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
<p>Hoffbein&rsquo;s eyes lost their whites. &ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s get on to people who have. Read
Ethridge&rsquo;s testimony, please, MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur picked up the long white sheet
of paper and began in an even voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Complying with the decision of the General
Staff of the Elijah Wilson Hospital, I admitted
Rose Standish, graduate nurse of this institution,
as a patient in Medicine Clinic, Ward B,
Bed 11, yesterday afternoon. The diagnosis, for
the benefit of the nursing staff, being a possible
tubercular effusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She received a routine examination from the
house staff and from seven-ten until seven-thirty
last evening my father, Dr. Sterling, and I went
over her. We found her lungs in excellent shape,
her heart slightly enlarged, but not seriously so,
her general physical condition splendid, with
the exception of the fact that she was somewhat
thin and underweight. There were no signs of
any malady of any kind whatever. Her temperature
was normal, her pulse good, though a little
rapid, which, considering the circumstances was
not surprising, and her spirits commendably
calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both felt most reassured by her mental
and physical condition, though my father, Dr.
Sterling, in case she might discover herself too
fatigued to sleep advised a sedative. We told
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
Miss Standish of the order and suggested she
call for the potion if she felt the necessity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was some vague hysteria in the ward,
which both Miss Standish and ourselves sensed,
and I understand from the seven-to-nine-student
nurses that she calmed it by conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The prescription for the potion was, later,
removed from Miss Standish&rsquo;s chart and is in
the possession of Dr. MacArthur, as is, also, the
testimony of a patient who claimed to have seen
Miss Kerr, student nurse, standing over Miss
Standish&rsquo;s bed for several seconds during the
thunderstorm which extinguished the lights at
nine-forty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the time we walked off the ward at
seven-thirty, until Mattus notified me of Rose
Standish&rsquo;s death at one-ten, I did not see Miss
Standish. Mattus saw her around ten and reported
her in practically the same condition in
which Father and I had left her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After seeing my father, Dr. Sterling, to his
car at seven-thirty, I went to dinner in the doctors&rsquo;
dining room, took a short walk, and was
in bed by eleven-thirty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Mattus notified me of Miss Standish&rsquo;s
death at one-ten, I immediately called Dr. MacArthur
who ordered an autopsy, tried to get my
father and learned that the cold he had complained
of was settling in his chest and his
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
temperature was 101. At his orders I got his
assistant, Dr. Withers, who in the presence of
Dr. MacArthur, Mattus and myself, performed
the autopsy, the findings of which will be given
by Dr. Heddis, who came in when it was half
finished and later took the organs for examination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the excellent forethought of
Mattus, we borrowed an operative patient from
Surgical Clinic and rolled her bed into the place
where Rose Standish&rsquo;s had stood and left orders
to say to the patients that Miss Standish had
hemorrhaged and been put in a private room.
From the time the ward awoke until the operation
was called, the new patient was in the process
of preparation and did not realize the change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the time of the discovery of Rose
Standish&rsquo;s corpse, until Mattus and I had rolled
the bed toward the elevator, the deportment of
William, the orderly, was most praiseworthy
and the demeanor of Miss Evelina Kerr astonishingly
calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the autopsy was still in progress, my
mother called to say that Dr. Sterling&rsquo;s temperature
had risen to 103, his breathing was labored
and he was requesting I come to him. Dr. MacArthur
insisted that I go. I found him with a
definite case of pneumonia, both lungs seriously
involved, pulse irregular, and breathing labored,
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
semi-delirious. I immediately called an ambulance
and brought him into the hospital for
oxygen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The response is disheartening. His heart is
weakening. I have remained by his bedside, again
through the advice of Dr. MacArthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dictated to Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s secretary, outside
room 511, Medicine Clinic, at 8:30 A. M.
Wednesday, May 18th.</p>
<p><span class="lr">&ldquo;(Signed): Ethridge Sterling, Jr., M.D.</span>
<span class="lr">Physician-in-Chief (Pro-tem),</span>
<span class="lr">The Elijah Wilson Hospital.&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. MacArthur laid the paper down and looked
from the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Questions?&rdquo; his voice was old and heavy, and
he brought his eyes back to the men with an effort.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison shot a glance around the room
and insisted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s continue with the evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur pushed a button upon his desk,
the door into the corridor opened and Miss Evelina
Kerr, night student nurse on Ward B, entered.</p>
<p>It was Princeton Peters who escorted her to the
chair beside Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s and Dr. Hoffbein
who would have liked to question her, had he not
felt Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s eyes judging his every thought;
so Dr. MacArthur turned to her and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been through another dreadful night.
I&rsquo;m sorry. Please tell about it carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>She sat as she had sat yesterday, her hands
primly in her lap and her flat feet carefully together,
her stubborn defiance breaking through her
voice.</p>
<p>She looked carefully around the large room before
she began to speak, and to Dr. MacArthur,
Dr. Harrison, and Dr. Barton, there flashed a
realization that her eyes were still too close together,
and that somehow she was enjoying her
importance.</p>
<p>But her survey did not escape Dr. Harrison.</p>
<p>He barked, &ldquo;Dr. Sterling is not here because his
father is desperately ill. Will you be so kind as to
tell your story, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Dr. Harrison, I will.&rdquo; The stupid definiteness
in her voice was maddening. She turned her
eyes upon Dr. Hoffbein and told her story to him.
She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I went on duty at nine I found Miss
Standish a patient in Bed 11, Ward B. She said
Dr. Sterling thought she might have a tubercular
effusion and she was in for observation. I gave her
her thermometer and ran to close the windows as
the rain had started.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when the lights went out, you were standing
by her bed, Miss Kerr,&rdquo; Dr. Barton announced
pointedly.</p>
<p>Her eyes did not leave Dr. Hoffbein, and she
replied:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<p>&ldquo;I had come back for the thermometer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer crashed like a broken plate, and Dr.
Harrison insisted:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I counted her pulse,&rdquo; her voice was
wooden, &ldquo;gave my medicines. Put out the flowers
and called Dr. Mattus about a woman with a heart
attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you give Miss Standish her sleeping
potion, when you were distributing medicines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Dr. Barton, Dr. Mattus came up to
the heart case and said not to give it to Miss Standish
unless she called for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After he went, I dimmed the lights, went to
work on my fever charts, made up the midnight
medicines, and began studying my nursing manual.
William, the orderly, came up the hall twice
to ask me about some dishes and the breakfast
trays, and then about eleven-thirty, Miss Standish
rang and asked for her sleeping potion, and I gave
it to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you gave her the right prescription?&rdquo;
Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s eyes had bored past Dr.
Hoffbein and into her.</p>
<p>She pouted her thick lips and lifted her ugly
chin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I&rsquo;m positive. She went to sleep right
away. You don&rsquo;t think, Dr. Harrison...?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
<p>&ldquo;What I think does not concern your story,
Miss Kerr. Please continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a slight tightening of her jaw, and
had she had sense enough to cry then, every man
in the room would have felt beaten. She continued
woodenly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I gave Miss Standish her medicine, the
next patient had to have her linen changed, and
when I had finished with that, Miss Standish was
asleep. I could tell by her breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was then almost midnight and I went to boil
my syringes for the midnight hypodermics, and
while I was boiling them Mrs. Witherspoon, the
patient whose bed I had just changed, rang again,
and I ran to see about her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And as I reached her bed, I found Dr. Cub
Sterling leaning over Miss Standish. He looked up
and nodded, and....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Repeat your last three sentences, Miss Kerr.
Repeat them twice! And look at me while you do
it.&rdquo; Dr. Hoffbein&rsquo;s voice was mesmeric.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr repeated them ... twice....</p>
<p>They filled the room and permeated the senses
of every man present like poison gas.</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison shot his gimlet-like brown eyes into
the narrow, close ones of the student nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are wrong, Miss Kerr. Dr. Ethridge
Sterling, Junior, was in his rooms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not! He was bending over Miss Standish. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
know it. His bushy hair, his funny shoulder....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. Harrison. He just nodded. Like he
always does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you <i>make</i> him speak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t stop to. We had no more clean linen
and I had to run for a bed-pan for Mrs. Witherspoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur&rsquo;s hand beat upon his desk ...
hopelessly....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, Miss Kerr.&rdquo; His voice was like a death-knell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when I came back he was gone. He had
hurried off the ward while I was getting the bed-pan.
And I went to Miss Standish as soon as I
could. She was still asleep. And I ran to William.
He was asleep. And then I started to &rsquo;phone the
night supervisor, but it was time to give my medicines
... and Aunt Roenna always told us even
if the building were burning down, the medical
patients must have their medicines on time. So I
began giving them their hypodermics. And when
I could, I went to look at Miss Standish. She was
still sleeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then I finished the medicines and fever
charts and called in the rounds ... I forgot to
mention about Dr. Sterling because the supervisor
rung off so quickly ... and I had to hurry from
the &rsquo;phone to give out three bed-pans. When I had
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
finished the bed-pans I went to look at Miss Standish
again and she was dead ... and so I called
Aunt Roenna....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s word hit her like a
brick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she had told me to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night before she went off duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She said, &lsquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll come over.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you both <i>expected</i> Rose Standish to die,
Miss Kerr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of this dialogue had gone on so swiftly that
the girl had failed to make her brain control her
speech. It had come out ... spontaneously....</p>
<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t either, only....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison decided that this was not the time
for the truth. He passed off her reply with, &ldquo;What
happened next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I called the night supervisor and Dr. Mattus,
and waited until they came. And then....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From that point forward we have several eye-witnesses.&rdquo;
Dr. MacArthur interrupted. &ldquo;Thank
you, Miss Kerr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked up his telephone and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nursing office, please. Miss Merrill, will you
please come for Miss Kerr, student nurse, and put
her to bed, and follow the orders given you this
morning. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The girl turned to speak and Dr. Harrison motioned
to Dr. Peters to open the door. He did so,
as Miss Merrill appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before we discuss this, let&rsquo;s have the other
witnesses,&rdquo; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s voice was relentless.
But it failed to puncture the self-righteous-I-told-you-so
posture of Doctors Peters, Paton and Hoffbein.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur said, &ldquo;I think we might dispense
with the orderly, William, and with the day white
nurse. According to the testimony of everybody
William slept through the murder. He is useless
either to condemn or confirm the girl&rsquo;s statement.
And the day white nurse seems to me completely
out of it. Here are Dr. Heddis and Rathbone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They entered and sat down quietly. The mental
heat of the room stifled them. They drew their
handkerchiefs quickly and Dr. Heddis mopped his
leonine head and Rathbone his bald head furiously.
Dr. Heddis felt himself sinking into the tension. He
spoke immediately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The findings upon the organs of Rose Standish,
gentlemen, are that she was murdered by coniine in
such a quantity that it took effect in about thirty
to forty minutes. The left arm bore a hypodermic
puncture; the injection was larger than that administered
in the other traceable case. Her liver,
spleen, lungs and stomach were suffused with the
odor and the substance. Because of the enormity
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
of the dose, indications are that the death was
painless. She died of the customary respiratory
paralysis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At least the testimony of these two men was definite
and sane. The staff sat forward attentively.
Dr. Harrison asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethridge mentions a sleeping potion in his
report...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Heddis turned toward Peter Rathbone.
Baldy&rsquo;s wide straight shoulders squared. His delivery
was impressive:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The potion was ... bread pills. Dr. Sterling,
Senior, came by the pharmacy, around six, and
left the order himself. It was his idea that if the
student nurse was doing the murdering and administered
the potion, without knowing its content
(the copy upon Miss Standish&rsquo;s chart was for an
intricate formula), she would create a trap for
herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur groaned, involuntarily. Hoffbein
stated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He overlooked the psychic effect upon the
patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems so, Doctor.&rdquo; Rathbone&rsquo;s words were
slow and measured: &ldquo;Dr. Heddis is unable to trace
a potion in the system, and I understand the student
nurse insists she administered the potion, so the
obvious assumption is that she is telling the truth
and the effect was psychic....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>&ldquo;Bear&rsquo;s endeavor to prove his son....&rdquo; Barton
ventured and Hoffbein realized suddenly that
he had been in temporary acquiescence with the
theory of Cub Sterling&rsquo;s innocence, and hastened
to add:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, Baldy ... er, Rathbone, except yourself
and Dr. Sterling, Senior, knew of the contents
of the potion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say, Doctor.&rdquo; Rathbone&rsquo;s mouth closed
tightly, and Heddis lifted his heavy body, as Barton
inquired:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With our methods of cadaver handling is putrefaction
possible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rathbone repeated the question to Dr. Heddis,
who answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly. Clip off a small portion of an arm
or leg, before embalming, and keep it....&rdquo; He
threw out his hand, &ldquo;To a toxicologist the synthetic
possibility seems increasingly unfeasible. Formulas
are too intricate, and the discovery of the
murderer that way would be worse than looking for
a penny in quicksand. Mean checking every organ
of every cadaver....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look for the administrator, not the manufacturer.
Someone with access to the patients in that
bed. Time enough after that person is found to
find out....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Dr. MacArthur and said, &ldquo;Any
hour night or day, Mac....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Rathbone, too, rose; his clear baritone filled the
room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The medicine closets of all floors of Medicine
Clinic were searched again today. They reveal no
coniine. The syringes check as to number but are
useless; the routine boiling eliminates any hope
of tracing that way. Is there anything else we can
do, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Rathbone,&rdquo; MacArthur&rsquo;s voice was hopeless
and affectionate. &ldquo;I wish there were. Thank
both of you, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were followed by Dr. Mattus, who came,
as Cub had done the day before with a doll tucked
under his arm. This time the dolly wore a blue
dress and frilled bonnet and said, &ldquo;Pa-pa. Pa-pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every man in the room shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake turn that damn thing over!&rdquo;
Dr. MacArthur ordered. &ldquo;Where did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Found it in the desk of Miss Roenna Kerr.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; It was Dr. Barton who expressed the
combined sentiments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s face was eerie with
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she was at Head Nurse Conference, and
I went into her office looking for some case reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you face her with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Dr. MacArthur, I did not. I brought it to
you. Only first, I happened, casually, to learn that
her niece won a similar doll at a street fair last
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
week. She went with a party of nurses during
her P. M.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison&rsquo;s fringe of white hair haloed his
face. He looked like a man coming out of torture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell what you know about last night, Mattus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. James, interne, and I examined Miss Standish
yesterday afternoon. Found her normal in
every respect and in good spirits. By Jove ...
when I came on the ward, Miss Roenna Kerr was
trying to put her in another bed ... and I
ordered her into Bed 11. Did not see Miss Standish
again until around ten when I was called to the
ward for a heart case. She was still awake and
cheerful; told her Dr. Bear had ordered a sleeping
potion and to call for it if she needed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was the potion?&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Veronal, sir. He handed me the prescription
as he left Medicine Clinic, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men stirred and Mattus continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw Miss Standish again, she was
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see Miss Roenna Kerr on the ward
after the murder?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. She arrived soon after I did and I
presumed Dr. Sterling, Junior, had sent for her.
That&rsquo;s all I know, sir. Except that Cub, Dr.
Sterling, Junior, left his father and made rounds
on that ward to calm the hysteria this morning
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
about nine and had the heaven-sent sense to say
his father was ill. The women are wallowing in
sympathy and have almost forgotten the death of
Miss Standish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Bear is sinking, gentlemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was gone, Dr. Peters suggested calling
Miss Roenna Kerr, but Dr. Harrison opposed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not on your life. You are out to convict Cub
Sterling. I&rsquo;m out to save him. Let&rsquo;s have it out
in plain words. Bear is on his deathbed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princeton interrupted abruptly, &ldquo;Harrison,
isn&rsquo;t there some hope? Dear Bear&rsquo;s physique....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Harrison turned on him coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. No, dear Peters. His eyes will not be better,
tomorrow. They will be closed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t you think we had better wait until
after the funeral?&rdquo; Prissy intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell, no!&rdquo; Harrison snorted. &ldquo;Bear Sterling
is the best friend I ever had. He dragged me out
of the gutter and made a doctor of me. Either his
son is cleared, or I&rsquo;ll not be caught at his funeral
with you skunks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His anger was so intense that nobody dared object.
Princeton wiped his brow clean with a lavender
silk handkerchief and Harrison continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cannot defend his son who by his own murderers
is accused of murdering patients. Well, I
know his son is innocent!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo; Hoffbein hypodermicked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By a method that none of you three could ever
comprehend. Because I trust the man. Now let&rsquo;s
get down to tacks. If Ethridge is innocent he ought
to be cleared before sunset. If he is guilty he ought
to be hanged before then. Clearing him or convicting
him with the police is out of the question. But
cleared he has got to be, and therefore I propose
that we instruct MacArthur to hire the best private
detectives in the United States to become patients
on B Ward and orderlies throughout the building,
with the right to question any or all of
us....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why ... why ... Harrison...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Princeton.... I beg your pardon,
Peters.... How do MacArthur and I know that
Miss Roenna Kerr and her niece are not working
as accomplices for you or Hoffbein in murdering
patients in Ethridge Sterling&rsquo;s clinic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, oh! Harrison you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> mean that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Peters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t realize what you are saying, man,&rdquo;
Hoffbein was soothingly calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, Hoffbein! I realize quite thoroughly that
Bear Sterling&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s reputation is as dear to Dr.
Barton and Dr. MacArthur and to myself as that
of any world-famous man who ever had a patient
in the Elijah Wilson Hospital. I would sooner,
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
much sooner, see the reputations of you three
scraped in the mire and flung away across the world
by the tabloids than to see the name of a man who
cannot be present to protect himself slurred by
your nasty insinuations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His good name is just as valuable to us as yours
are ... more so ... and so far as we are concerned
your honor needs cleansing a great deal
more than his does. The only way to cleanse
any of our reputations now is to quit treating
every person ... <i>whatever his rank</i> ... involved
in this matter ... as innocent, and consider
all of us guilty until the criminal is caught.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do any of you suspect MacArthur? Well, that&rsquo;s
something in your favor. MacArthur, you hire the
detectives, and instruct them to consider all of us
guilty ... until we are proved innocent....</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in case any of you have any scruples whatever
about talking I wish you to remember that
Barton&rsquo;s brother is the Attorney-General of this
state and at one word from MacArthur he will have
all of you <i>made</i> to talk ... to save your own
reputations, let alone that of the blessed hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Roenna Kerr, working through her niece
as accomplice, outside of Ethridge Sterling, Junior,
is the other suspect. She has been a patient of
every man sitting in this room with the exception
of Dr. Barton, Dr. MacArthur and myself. Consider
your position, gentlemen....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<h2 id="c7">&raquo;VII&laquo;
<br />The New Patient in Bed Eleven</h2>
<p>Dr. MacArthur flapped the yellow
telegram helplessly and wondered how to face
them. Through some pull or other they had made
the mail plane from New York and would be in
his office in fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>Two men and a woman. Three detectives; and
he had never faced a detective in his life. How did
a man treat detectives? Must one defer, or order?</p>
<p>Probably Harrison would know. A urologist had
every profession in his grip sooner or later. He
reached for the telephone. Dr. Harrison laughed
at the question. It was the first time he had laughed
since entering the hospital that morning, learning
of Rose Standish&rsquo;s death and realizing that Bear
Sterling&rsquo;s was only a matter of sixty or seventy
hours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are tired, aren&rsquo;t you, Mac? Give &rsquo;em some
infant feeding and a dose of paregoric once around!
Buck up, old man! I suggest you tell the truth,
the whole truth, and let them create their own
suspicions.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
<p>&ldquo;Remember they were hand-picked by the Rockefeller
Foundation. They are intelligent. Newspaper
reporters grown up ... and you&rsquo;re a whiz
with newspaper reporters. Call me if you need me.
&rsquo;By!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur was reassured. Like an oak,
Harrison! Tried, staunch and straight!</p>
<p>His secretary entered and said, &ldquo;Two men and
a woman to see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show them in, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men were carrying handbags and overcoats.
The first was tall and dignified. He had a
long square body. Everything about him was muscular,
under perfect control and heavy-set. His
eyes, suit, overcoat, and hair were gray. His teeth
were strong and even. His eyes showed the same
steely calm that Bear Sterling&rsquo;s had. Judgmatical.
The enemy was death; the man you were after, or
yours. So far he had been lucky, and he had a
lucky man&rsquo;s nonchalance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur? Matthew Higgins is my
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was deep and buoyant.</p>
<p>His handclasp was like a vice. It steadied Dr.
MacArthur like a cup of strong coffee.</p>
<p>The voice continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smooty, Dr. MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smooty was slight. His body and face were
completely relaxed and pastel. Green eyes melted
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
into mild cheeks. He had the utter inactivity and
extreme alertness of a clown and the fading quality
of a chameleon.</p>
<p>His grip was like that of a contortionist. One
had to find it.</p>
<p>His voice was colorless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Delighted to know you, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins turned to the woman and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Miss Parkins. I should
have introduced you first, but air-travel leaves me
woozy. Miss Parkins, Dr. MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur was her kind and she sensed it. She
stretched her capable hand and smiled. Their summary
was like sun on metal.</p>
<p>One could never lose memory of her physically.
She was tall, square-shouldered, with the long,
slender legs of a gracefully tall woman. Her face
was ugly and expressive. The nose was too short,
the mouth too wide, but the flashes were sudden
and revealing. They were as vivid, highly original
and occasionally blank as heat lightning. And
massed in with her extreme directness was a wistful,
childlike appeal.</p>
<p>Her limpid eyes flashed into life as Dr. MacArthur
carefully seated her, took her coat and motioned
the men to chairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pleasant trip, I hope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was old and courteous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; the gray man was the spokesman. &ldquo;This
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
letter,&rdquo; he drew a thick envelope from his inside
coat pocket and handed it to MacArthur, &ldquo;we were
instructed, Doctor, to request that you read it
immediately upon our arrival.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur took the letter and carefully
tore the flap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said looking up. Then he rose
and offered the men and the woman cigarettes,
struck a match and extended it to the woman. He
always offered newspaper reporters cigarettes, and
Harrison had said detectives were....</p>
<p>Miss Parkins smiled, took the match, lighted,
and passed it.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur returned to his chair and began
reading and she said, &ldquo;Three on a match. Unlucky!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then they were silent. The air was full of estimation.
The letter was long, and evidently from
the head of the detective agency. It was addressed
to Dr. MacArthur and said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Higgins has been in our employ about
fifteen years and handled many executive jobs.
Your request was for a man capable of impersonating
a well-to-do patient, or a member of
the administrative staff of a distant hospital;
a man who may be given full run of the hospital
and thereby an opportunity, we gather, to question,
without creating suspicion, in every department.
We have recently had Mr. Higgins upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
a job necessitating the trapping of an embezzler
within one of our largest New York hospitals.
He has our complete confidence, a worldwide
experience with people, and an excellent
judgment of men. We have found him especially
successful in catching mental criminals, and from
Dr. Bridgman of the Rockefeller, we judge that
is your problem.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Smooty has long experience in impersonations.
He has done confidence work in Sing-Sing,
department stores, and as a hotel detective;
also we have used him in the Pennsylvania
Station. His nondescript appearance is an excellent
foil for his capabilities. You asked for
a man who might be placed as a menial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and Mr. Higgins have worked together
for many years and are among the first ranking
detectives in America. Mr. Smooty is originally
an Englishman and has also done work for Scotland
Yard and in the British Intelligence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr. MacArthur took his handkerchief from his
pocket and blew his nose. This was the first time,
to his knowledge, he had ever sat in the presence
of a Scotland Yard man. And as a little boy, next
to being a dogcatcher, to belong to Scotland Yard....
It left him rather awed. Maybe the woman
was a Russian Grand Duchess!</p>
<p>He returned his attention, his eyes had never
left it, to the letter and read:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parkins has done international and
character work for us for about five years. She,
in our opinion, is capable of any situation
where courage, brains, and mixing abilities are
required. Within the last year we have had her
upon one of the big liners between New York
and Cherbourg, on the road with the circus, and
living as an immigrant on the East Side. During
the war, she worked for the Government in
Mexico. She, we understand, you desire as a
patient on a ward of medical women. She has
an unfortunate, and slight, heart ailment, which
will serve to divert the suspicion of even your
staff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The terrible delicacy with which the situation
must be handled has occasioned our sending
what we consider the three most able people in
New York. Miss Parkins was taken off political
work today at the insistence of Dr. Bridgman,
through whom we were contacted, and who seems
to feel that the patient in the ward of medical
women is the key person. All three people were
interviewed by and met with the approval of
Dr. Bridgman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our terms, which at his suggestion we state,
are $2000.00 per week and maintenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awaiting your orders,</p>
<p><span class="center">&ldquo;We are....&rdquo;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>Dr. MacArthur carefully folded the letter and
decided to take Harrison&rsquo;s advice. Two thousand
dollars a week ... it took brains and plenty of
them to be able to demand that!</p>
<p>The late afternoon sun had left the room. He
looked up and discovered the room was semi-dark,
and the three people were sitting motionless. The
door into the corridor was still open; he had been
too rattled to close it when they entered. The measured
and constant footfalls of the thousands of
feet had padded into his consciousness so long that
he didn&rsquo;t sense it, but they must.</p>
<p>He rose, closed the door, turned up the lights
and said, as he walked toward the windows to lower
the shades, &ldquo;Sorry to subject you to all of that
racket. Time for duty changes. Hospitals are noisy
places.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins had risen and was pulling down
the shades, too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So is New York, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur nodded and returned to his desk.
He looked at his wrist watch and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Parkins, Mr. Higgins and Mr. Smooty,
if we are to get Miss Parkins on Ward B as a
patient tonight, my r&eacute;sum&eacute; must necessarily be
shorter than I should desire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were sent for because there have been committed
in the Elijah Wilson Hospital within the
last week two traceable murders, proved by autopsy
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
findings, and two deaths ... in the same bed. The
deaths (we presume them murders also) preceded
the murders. The last person murdered was a nurse
who volunteered to go into the bed in an effort to
solve the mystery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins moved restlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know we have been slow in calling you in,
Mr. Higgins. But this decision was only reached
after a series of long and irascible conferences, and
frankly I was against it, until the nurse was murdered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hospital, you see ... a great hospital ...
lives, breathes, exists, as a fountain of hope. It is
trusted by <i>everybody</i>. For more than forty years
the Elijah Wilson has lived up to that trust. We
have received endowments, and large ones, to add
units to our plant for the teaching of medical
students. We were started, have been perpetuated,
and are famous as a great teaching hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now a teaching hospital, Miss Parkins, exists
upon the fact that it has more patients than beds.
When you have that situation reversed, the hospital
is doomed. D&rsquo;y&rsquo;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three people nodded, and Dr. MacArthur
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If any of you three walked out of this room and
gave to the press of this country the information
I have just given you in the last five minutes, you
would automatically ruin the future of every medical
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
man, resident, student and interne here, the
hope of renewed health in a very large portion of
suffering humanity, the years and painstaking
labor of many famous men, now dead, whose lives
were given, as bricks are given, to the building of
this hospital&rsquo;s justified fame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been upon the complete realization of
that grave responsibility that our hesitation was
based. I admit that we were mistaken, but our situation
was so unexpected, so unparalleled, and so
terrifying, that we dared not alter one straw for
fear of losing our needle in this great haystack.
There are at least fifteen people who may have
been guilty of this crime. If they suspect...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any suspects, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Higgins. That was why I finally succumbed
to sending for the best detectives that this
country has to offer. My nursing and medical staffs
are beginning to suspect themselves ... and each
other....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see! I see, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All four patients were nursed and attended by
the same staff members?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Parkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I suggest, in fact, request, sir,&rdquo; Mr. Higgins
intervened, &ldquo;that you do not tell us who your
suspects are. It will cloud our work. An open mind
and a lack of tradition.... Oh, no. Doctor, ...
we are completely aware of that and will guard it,
<span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
sir, with our lives.... I am referring to personal
tradition with reference to staff members....</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lack of belief in the honesty of any man we
contact because he is famous, or brilliant, or noted,
will be one of the most invaluable things we can
have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now to return to the murders. What do the
autopsy findings show, exactly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That they were committed with the same drug.
Coniine, the active principal of hemlock. Administered
hypodermically and in the first case which
took effect in a little over an hour and in the second
case within less than forty minutes. The second
dose, that given the nurse was much larger. Our
chief pharmacist has checked the supply sources.
We have never had any coniine in the hospital, and
it can be secured from only three houses in the
country. None of them reports recent sales. We
have wired all three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, qualified to administer a hypodermic,
had access to the patients?&rdquo; Mr. Higgins&rsquo; voice
was low and sudden.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s was clear and calm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The entire nursing and medical staff practicing
upon that floor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Smooty sat blankly by. Miss Parkins took
her second cigarette from her mouth and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the hypodermics compounded in the pharmacy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. On the floor. By the nurse on duty, acting
only upon prescription from the attending physician.
The medicine closets on the ward ... and
every floor of that building ... have been
searched after each murder. They reveal nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When were the murders discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At night, Miss Parkins. After midnight rounds
made by the student nurse. Perhaps I had better
give you a full picture. The ward contains thirty
beds, in four rows, each seven being separated by
a glass partition. The two extra beds are in rooms
for dying patients. Each ward has a day white
(graduate) nurse, and four student nurses on
duty. Their duty changes as to hours are not important
to this case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The white nurse goes off duty for the night at
seven, and leaves her instructions with two student
nurses who prepare the ward for the night, and go
off duty at nine, when a single student nurse (bringing
the total of student nurses to five) usually a
pupil within the last six months of training, comes
on and &lsquo;beds the ward down&rsquo; for the night and
remains on duty until seven the following morning.
It is her business to give all night hypodermics
and medicines, and make regular rounds upon the
patients to see how they are. On the ward with her
is an orderly, who runs any sudden errands and
helps with any manual labor. He usually remains
in the ward-kitchen washing dishes and preparing
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
the breakfast trays and cleaning the ward corridors,
etc. The orderly on this ward has been there
twenty years, and is not capable of any remarkable
murder. A trusted menial. He has been ordered
into bed, as a suspected typhoid carrier, tonight,
and it is his position which you are to fill, Mr.
Smooty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An imperceptible nod was Mr. Smooty&rsquo;s only
acknowledgment.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the entire building at night there is a night
supervisor who makes floor rounds upon the student
nurses in charge and is available in case they get
into difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was she during the murders, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the first one, in the lavatory, Miss
Parkins, and during the second her telephone did
not answer and she was making rounds in the
building.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. The student nurse...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go into her,&rdquo; Mr. Higgins ordered.
&ldquo;Take her with an open mind. You and Smooty
tell us about her tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins leaned forward and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any way to enter the ward, except by the corridor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur hesitated a moment; his eyes
narrowed suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t thought of it, sir, but there is. In the
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
rebuilding, the porch of each floor, upon which the
convalescent patients are rolled, is connected with
the porch of the floor below by a narrow concrete
stairway. Wide enough to permit a stretcher, as a
matter of fact. Satisfies fire regulations and does
away with fire-escapes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins nodded.</p>
<p>MacArthur continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the door to that porch is always locked at
night. The key is on the inside. All of our combined
evidence points to an entry via the ward
corridor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins nodded again.</p>
<p>Then to Dr. MacArthur he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Outside of the autopsy findings are there any
pieces of evidence which re-occur after the murders,
Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. After the first, the student nurse claimed
that she felt someone on the floor, but was boiling
a syringe and could not leave and that a patient
said it was....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins stopped him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is just what I do not want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; Miss Parkins insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For six months, Mr. Higgins, we have had on
that ward a little girl, a chronic nephritis ...&rdquo;
he looked over his glasses and explained to Miss
Parkins, &ldquo;a kidney ailment of a very stubborn
sort.... She is really pretty and quite a favorite
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
throughout the hospital. Upon her crib, the morning
after the first traceable murder she found a
doll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened his desk drawer and took out the
Ma-ma doll. Miss Parkins reached for it to
straighten the bonnet, and it howled. She turned
it over quickly and Mr. Smooty said, &ldquo;Jesus
Christ!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the first response he had made to any
of the information. Mr. Higgins ignored it and
said, &ldquo;Finger-prints?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It had been handled by many people when we
got it, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course. After the second murder, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no doll upon her bed, but this doll
was found....&rdquo; and he reached for the Pa-pa
doll and handed it to Mr. Smooty, whose green
eyes were like pin points.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where, Doctor?&rdquo; his voice was again colorless.</p>
<p>But his interest was so concentrated that he
forgot and turned the doll over and it whined,
&ldquo;Pa-pa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody jumped and Mr. Higgins reached
for both of them and laid them on the mahogany
table upon their backs. They closed their eyes and
Miss Parkins looked at the crisp bonnets, dresses
and panties and shivered.</p>
<p>Two dolls. Two murders.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>&ldquo;I think we should know where it was found,
Doctor,&rdquo; Mr. Higgins&rsquo; voice was firm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the desk of the Head Nurse of Medicine
Clinic, sir. A doctor looking for case charts discovered
it, accidentally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she friendly with the night student nurse?&rdquo;
It was Smooty who spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is her aunt, gentlemen,&rdquo; and then Dr. MacArthur
cleared his throat and continued, &ldquo;She was
one of the first head nurses when the hospital was
young. Her work has always been well executed. A
very trusted woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Especially antagonistic to any doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The head of the clinic, Dr. Ethridge Sterling,
Junior, affectionately known as &lsquo;Cub&rsquo; Sterling.
He is on probation, very confidentially, as head.
The physician-in-chief died of a heart attack last
spring, and Dr. Sterling, who has done very brilliant
work, has temporarily his chief&rsquo;s place. His
father is Dr. Ethridge Sterling, possibly you have
heard...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The surgeon. Bear Sterling! I should say so!&rdquo;
Higgins responded. &ldquo;Why is the head nurse antagonistic?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know. Perhaps because she is getting
old and is afraid of retirement if Sterling remains
in charge.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Pretty ugly situation you have been in,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t I, it&rsquo;s the hospital. Dr. Ethridge Sterling,
Senior, is dying of a heart attack complicated
by pneumonia brought on by this situation. One
of our graduate nurses has been murdered....
Frankly, your coming shifts a great weight from
my shoulders. And I should like to say if I have
failed to make anything clear, question me. We
are all a bit shell-shocked, I dare say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, there is, Doctor. Did Dr. Sterling, Senior,
see all of the murdered patients, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did. He performed the autopsies on all except
the last one. The nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has any person been murdered since he has
been out of the picture?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins&rsquo; weight was behind his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I understand you, Mr. Higgins,&rdquo;
Dr. MacArthur gripped his chair arms, and his
sensitive mouth looked like blistered flesh.</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins ignored that and attacked his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Doctor, but that is exactly the reason
you sent for us. To understand things. Please
answer my question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was taken with double pneumonia last night,
and Rose Standish was murdered last night. The
bed is empty now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he saw her and left a sleeping potion of
which you told Dr. Bridgman over the &rsquo;phone and
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
after that was administered she was murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, Mr. Higgins,&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s knuckles
were white against the desk, &ldquo;I have learned
that potion was ... bread-pills.... He had
hoped to calm her nerves and yet leave her capable
of catching.... I would swear before God that
Dr. Sterling....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would, sir,&rdquo; there was admiration
in Mr. Higgins&rsquo; response, &ldquo;but painful operations
are often necessary, and since he is the only
person who has retired from the case, since the
beginning, I am obliged to know what developments
have taken place since his retirement. It&rsquo;s
like chess, Doctor, your moves depend upon your
position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur had regained complete control
of himself and Miss Parkins had risen and poured
out a glass of water from a thermos bottle upon
the mantelpiece which she was holding out to him.
She smiled and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been a long strain and you have stood it
magnificently. Is there anything else you wish to
tell us before Smooty and I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her strength passed through him and he
straightened himself, and Mr. Higgins said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If brought in as an accident, what are the
chances of Miss Parkins being put in this bed
... number...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleven.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>The eyes of the other three people were upon
Higgins, inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, Doctor, in view of the information
I now have in hand relative to the head nurse and
her niece ... by the way, what are their names?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kerr. K-e-r-r.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only Mr. Smooty&rsquo;s lips fought to remain a
straight line. The concentration of the other three
was too intense to notice the expression.</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins placed his gray eyes upon Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s
blue ones and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Miss Parkins goes on the ward in a routine
way as a patient, she will automatically be suspected
by them and therefore become less valuable
to us. But if she falls upon the street with a heart
attack within four blocks of the hospital, arrives
at the accident room entrance in an ambulance, and
is admitted to Ward B, Bed 11.... You see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can we be sure that she will be placed in Bed
11, sir? That the staff in the accident room will
admit her for medical treatment and that she will
be sent to that floor and put in that bed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A moment and I&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur
reached for his telephone and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superintendent of nurses, please. Miss Carruthers?
Dr. MacArthur. Will you please ascertain
for your <i>own</i> information the vacant beds in
<span class="pb" id="Page_215">215</span>
Medicine Clinic and their location, and call me
back immediately? Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned to Miss Parkins and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What kind of ailment is it? How bad?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a false angina, and during the attacks
causes extreme palpitation. By intense excitement
I can create a definite change in my heart action,
and the other symptoms are permanent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. Given you much trouble?&rdquo; MacArthur
was solicitous.</p>
<p>The telephone interrupted.</p>
<p>He answered and took his pencil, wrote upon a
memorandum pad and repeated:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Medicine, Ward A&mdash;7 &amp; 8, Ward B&mdash;11, and
5th floor, rooms 502 &amp; 514. Thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unknown accident case, with a heart ailment,
Mr. Higgins, picked up on the street and
admitted through the accident room, would undoubtedly
be placed in Bed 11, Ward B. Ward A,
which has two vacant beds, is medical men, and
floor five is private rooms. You are too well-dressed,
though, Miss Parkins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If her pocketbook contained only one dollar
and she had no addresses upon her person, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They would not take a chance on someone paying
for a private room, Mr. Higgins. You are right.
The only chance is whether she can pass the accident
staff, as I see it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is a chance we have to take,&rdquo; Mr. Higgins
decided.</p>
<p>He looked at his wrist watch and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more question, Doctor, and then, with your
permission I should like to have some private place
where I may talk to Mr. Smooty and Miss Parkins
before we turn Miss Parkins out upon the street
and you take Mr. Smooty to the head orderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two more questions, now I think of it. The
first: How is the hysteria throughout the hospital?
The second: You expect, of course, that Mr.
Smooty will be suspected as a detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the last question has the shortest answer,
I will go to that first. That seems to me unavoidable,
Mr. Higgins, and perhaps will work to our
advantage. It will focus attention, from the nursing,
medical and menial staffs, upon one person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the hysteria in the hospital. It is at a
dangerous level and rising hourly. Not among the
patients, yet.... Thank God! ... with the exception
of the patients on Ward B and they have
been told that Miss Standish, the nurse, hemorrhaged
(we put her in as a tubercular suspect) and
although they probably believe her dead, they
have no proof. And their attention has been diverted
by the terrible condition of Dr. Sterling,
Senior. He has always been a great favorite
throughout the wards. Patients love him. The other
patients, on the other wards are too segregated
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
and many of them too dangerously ill to be excited
or aware of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to Miss Carruthers, our superintendent
of nurses, to whom I was just talking, the
hysteria among the nursing staff is serious. Before
the death of the nurse they took the excitement
mildly, with the exception of the people in Medicine
Clinic who were questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the exception of the General Staff, the
toxicologist, the chief pharmacist, and the staff of
Medical Clinic, no persons in the hospital have any
definite knowledge as to whether these patients are
murders or fadeouts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps it is that lack of knowledge which has
so increased the fever heat among the medical
staffs. They suspect, but they <i>do not know</i>. And
half knowledge, and especially around a hospital....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw his hands out hopelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the death of the nurse, the entire medical
and nursing services have been at a breaking point.
Their internal pressure can be felt in every dining
room. Something must be done and done immediately.
That is one of the reasons I approve
of the word getting around that a detective has
been put on Ward B at night....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wise attitude, Doctor. Now if you will be so
kind as to give us a private room and a few
minutes?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>&ldquo;I suggest you use my office and allow me to
retire. After Miss Parkins has gone, I will show
you a room in which you and Mr. Smooty may meet,
when you desire. A laboratory in an unfrequented
part of the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose wearily and passed out of the door and
closed it carefully behind him.</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins lit a cigarette and turned to the
other two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you make of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He questioned both of them in one sentence.</p>
<p>Miss Parkins answered, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s square. But he is
shielding someone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Smooty inserted his sentence at the end of
hers. &ldquo;Honest as the King. But worried sick. There
is somebody he considers innocent, that the others
have dots on. All I got to say is somebody around
here is crazy as hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Higgins, who had never been sick a day in
his life and never slept in a hospital even so much
as one night, had a healthy man&rsquo;s antagonism for
the medical profession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toughest job we&rsquo;ve ever had. He&rsquo;s square all
right, but how the hell can you catch a murderer
in a hospital? You are right, Snod. Somebody
around here is crazy as a tick. And lots of people
are lying. One thing you got to remember is you
are up against professional liars. All nurses and
doctors are professional liars. Didn&rsquo;t one tell me
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
my mother was &lsquo;doing nicely&rsquo; when she had been
dead an hour? So watch everybody in the same
way you watch a spy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s also covering somebody that everybody
else believes guilty. I think I know whom he is covering.
But that&rsquo;ll wait. He suspects that head
nurse and her niece. That&rsquo;s plain as day. And he
didn&rsquo;t tell the truth about why he thinks she is
doing it. There&rsquo;s somebody behind them, in his
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment to draw breath and
Miss Parkins flipped her cigarette and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matt, I&rsquo;d like a gun, if you don&rsquo;t mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scared, Lil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m never scared. Especially when I have
a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Lil.&rdquo; He put his big square
hand over her capable one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll strip you to the bone when you go
through that accident racket. A gun is out of the
question. You&rsquo;ll have Snod.&rdquo; He motioned to Mr.
Smooty.</p>
<p>She smiled but she wasn&rsquo;t reassured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is slow as hell about wiping dishes when
you are having a Sunday night supper. I couldn&rsquo;t
get him out of that kitchen till I&rsquo;d been dead hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smooty&rsquo;s green eyes took on life for the first
time since he had entered the room. He said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hospital&rsquo;s duty is to protect everybody. I&rsquo;ll
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
be a member of a hospital staff in twenty minutes,
Lil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She shrugged her square shoulders and her
limpid eyes begged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The murderer is a member of the hospital staff,
Snod. He&rsquo;ll beat you to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins intervened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, Lil! Hold on to yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s those damn dolls,&rdquo; she laughed.</p>
<p>Higgins smiled strongly into her eyes and threw
his overcoat over the dolls. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s enough hysteria
around here as it is. Don&rsquo;t add to it. Unless
Snod has something to say I guess you might just
as well sneak out and do your fainting fit. Want
me to send you flowers when you get sick, little
girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Matt. Flowers are not funny in this
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened her handbag and took out three
hundred dollars in fifty dollar bills and counted
them carefully. Beside them she laid the cards of
a speakeasy on West 11th Street and of one on
44th. She opened the zipper center of the black
alligator bag and took from it her identification
card with the agency and the picture of a man
in an officer&rsquo;s uniform of the British Intelligence.
Near these she spread a large white silk handkerchief
into which she scooped the outlay, and then
removed from her wrist a large sapphire and diamond
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
wrist watch. She closed the bag, first counting
the money remaining. One dollar bill and three
dimes and a nickel. Then she tied the contents of
the bag in the large silk handkerchief and handed
it to Higgins.</p>
<p>He took it carefully and put it in his coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going, Lil?&rdquo; His gray eyes looked up into her
limpid ones confidently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now. See you later.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She opened the door and disappeared.</p>
<p class="tb">Miss Evelina Kerr, student night nurse on Ward
B, Medicine Clinic, shook down the thermometer
and inserted it into the mouth of the new patient
in Bed 11, with an air of relief, and just a touch
of condescension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening. Have you remembered your
name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Lillian Parkins weakly shook her head
and her eyes were sad.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr, who had been over the clothes in the
locker, knew that the coat was expensive and the
fur good, but that she had no money, so gave her
her &ldquo;free patient&rdquo; smile and passed on.</p>
<p>Lillian Parkins lay inert and tried to clear her
mind. A long plane trip, then the terrible strain
of appearing ill before the prying eyes of two
internes and that little Jewish resident doctor had
left her weak as dishwater. A touch of straight
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
scotch was what she needed.... It was damn
hard to relax and veil your eyes and yet see everything.
Still that was the game, that was what made
the job so ... fascinating!</p>
<p>That girl&rsquo;s eyes were too close, and there was
an ugly sense of triumph when she had found her
in the bed, and a nasty condescension, and a dead
voice, creepy kind of! Somewhere she had seen a
woman who moved like that with a voice like that,
a stubborn little mind like that who ... who ...
hands like snakes, or bananas, who ... was it?</p>
<p>She closed her eyes to keep the life out of them,
and began to check cases. On the Leviathan last
year, in that Welfare Island group in May, doing
that route collecting for pimps on the Southern
circuit? No! None of those, but somewhere within
the last eighteen months....</p>
<p>Ah, she had it. That medium who worked for
the hypnotist in the side-show and peddled dope in
the circus. That vicious little adder who had tried
to throw acid in her eyes when she caught her with
the goods. Whew! Lord!</p>
<p>The goose-flesh began to stand out on her arms
and legs. That&rsquo;s who she was, the same automaton
voice, the same kind of little snake, out working
for a python and she had to face her without so
much as an automatic and go to sleep while she
was doing it. Not go to sleep. Not on your life.
Feign sleep! Feign sleep for ten hours, and then
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
somehow manage not to have a real heart attack
and pass out honest!</p>
<p>Swell job this was! Lots of fun! If she could get
her hands on Matt Higgins now! Somehow she
had to have a word with Snod. And quick!</p>
<p>Around her the monotonous conversation of the
ward was droning, but since she was supposed to
be too weak to talk, she closed her mind to it. Except
for the realization that these women were
afraid of the night. Had stood the day, but were
afraid of the night and wanted to tell her about
the bed. Wanted desperately to warn her ...
somehow. The lapping conversation and her own
preoccupation made her unaware of Miss Kerr&rsquo;s
return, until she felt the thermometer eased from
her lips, and shivered.</p>
<p>Reptile who moved like that would have a hypodermic
in you before you knew it.</p>
<p>She kept her eyes closed and pretended complete
fatigue. Miss Kerr&rsquo;s pleasure at her presence
seemed to increase. She said briskly and jubilantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be around before you know it. Your
pulse and temperature are pretty good, considering.
Your medicine will be along in a minute and
then you can have a good night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Parkins opened her eyes feebly and gave
her the fading lily smile. Miss Kerr returned it
with the &ldquo;miserable object&rdquo; expression.</p>
<p>But had Miss Lillian Parkins been less of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
consummate actress, the glimpse of Snod Smooty,
late of Scotland Yard and the British Intelligence,
now arrayed in the nondescript white coat of a
hospital orderly, and carrying, as a hotel porter
might bags, an assortment of bed-pans, would have
shattered her facial control.</p>
<p>He was on the ward before Miss Kerr had seen
him. His face was as vacant as a concrete highway
and his voice was as deferential as a butler&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, Miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The laughter of the women made Miss Kerr ease
around, and when her slow eyes had taken in the
situation, her routine mind exploded into wrath,
remarkably spontaneous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you to do that? You are not supposed
to bring the bed-pans on the ward. I ...
I....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smooty swallowed like a hurt child and one pan
started slipping toward the floor. Miss Kerr slunk
forward and caught it.</p>
<p>Mrs. Witherspoon spoke up:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be upset, Miss Kerr. We understands.
And now thet he&rsquo;s here....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Kerr looked appraisingly toward Mrs.
Witherspoon and tried to deny her.</p>
<p>A very insistent telephone commanded her attention
and threw her routine existence out of
whack. She was told to prepare for a new patient
and spent five minutes explaining to the night
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
superintendent that the bed was already given
to an accident room case and the patient would
have to....</p>
<p>The orderly took advantage of the opportunity
and began handing out pans along the side of the
ward where Miss Parkins lay. It was Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s,
&ldquo;Pull the curtains. Pull the curtains.
Quick!&rdquo; which gave him an opportunity to speak
to Miss Parkins unobserved.</p>
<p>He said, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll watch her, close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick to her, Snod. For God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes came to life and strengthened her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t do anything tonight. She won&rsquo;t get
around an old pan-handler like me. If you are
scared as you say you are, you must have the....
Here&rsquo;s a pan!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thrust one at her and moved on.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr re-entered the ward and said crisply,
&ldquo;William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horace, mam,&rdquo; he corrected as he handed the
circus performer her pan.</p>
<p>The girl was disconcerted by the correction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, really. The thing that
matters is that you are to stay off this ward unless
I call you. There is plenty of work for you in the
kitchen. Go down to Ward A and get me a syringe.
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
I&rsquo;ve already called Miss Wilson about your coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod Smooty looked blankly up at the nurse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hypo syringe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Of course. Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought he detected a slight dilation of her
pupils, and replied carelessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Miss, at St. Giles, in London, we always
called enemas syringes. I jus&rsquo; needs to know,
you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you there, Horace?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t braggin&rsquo; Miss, but I was an orderly
there four years. That&rsquo;s how come I brought the
bed-pans; we done it that way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw his helpless hands out in an explanatory
gesture and shambled down the corridor.</p>
<p>Miss Evelina Kerr sat down at her desk to regain
her control. She should have gone on with
the routine. But she sat down. Things weren&rsquo;t
going so well. That man was a detective as sure
as life and he was lying, and Aunt Roenna ought
to know....</p>
<p>She picked up the telephone and started to take
the receiver from the hook, and then she jumped
up and somehow smothered a scream.</p>
<p>Standing over her, peering down into her little,
piggish eyes with his steel-gray slits was a tall,
fat man, in a blue uniform with brass buttons. In
his right hand he held a bunch of red American
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
Beauty roses, and the other was in a side pocket.</p>
<p>Miss Kerr thought he was a policeman and the
left hand was upon his pistol holster. He carefully
placed the roses in the elbow of the left arm, and
with his right hand drew her out into the ward.
His grip was strong and heavy.</p>
<p>By that time Miss Kerr had regained her
breath. She tried to snatch her arm away and
cringed when she failed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To shee the night nurse on Ward B.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the night nurse.&rdquo; Her voice still quaked.</p>
<p>Gripping her like a vice, he stuck his thick face
into hers and the stench of his breath reached the
whole ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y&rsquo;re not Rhosh Standziz! Where is Rosh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then swaying as a top-heavy steamer might
when tied to a brittle mooring, he turned to the
ward and announced:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;se bin in luz wiz Rosh, scincz ... sincz ...
sincz ...&rdquo; he shook his head helplessly and the
motion seemed to straighten his tongue, temporarily....
&ldquo;I just came back from China Station. They
said over the &rsquo;phone last night Rose was on Ward
B.&rdquo; His voice clouded again. &ldquo;Sho I brought her
shum r ... r ... rhozes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laid the flowers upon a bed and took Miss
Kerr&rsquo;s face in both of his hands. By that time every
woman on the ward was sitting bolt upright regardless
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
of her condition. A fly would have sounded like
an airplane.</p>
<p>Crushing her face with his hands, he demanded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swhere iz Rosh? Zhu! Phoo! Zhu ain&rsquo;t Rosh!&rdquo;
and then his voice took on a hide-and-seek tenor.</p>
<p>And he crushed with more force, and they both
swayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Swherah ... iz ... Rosh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lillian Parkins sat like a race horse at the starter.
Every time he crushed the nurse, she thanked him
... silently....</p>
<p>He swayed horribly and they staggered.</p>
<p>He increased his grip and his voice was brutal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stell me! St-ell me! Swhere iz Rosh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose is dead!&rdquo; Miss Kerr&rsquo;s voice had taken on
life at last. Every woman in the ward heard her
remark.</p>
<p>And it was Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s horrible,
scrunching scream that came like the brakes of a
truck after an accident, which shocked the other
women into silence and brought Horace, the new
orderly, up the corridor on the run.</p>
<p>And with that scream the brain of Lieutenant
Brady, U.S.N. disintegrated. He loosened his grip
upon the student nurse and flung her to the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosh iz dead! Dead in a hoshbittle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began skipping around as a child might and
singing monotonously, &ldquo;Ring aroun&rsquo; de Roshy!
Rosh&rsquo;s dead. Rosh&rsquo;s dead. Ring aroun&rsquo; de Roshy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Then he caught the approaching Horace out of
the corner of his eye and laughed hollowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cash me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began rolling under the patients&rsquo; beds, playing
a literal hide-and-seek with both the student
nurse, who had staggered to her feet, and the nimble
orderly who was saying in a loud voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are dead drunk! You ... fool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The final scramble took place under the bed of
Lillian Parkins and Miss Kerr ran to the telephone
to call the night superintendent.</p>
<p>As Snod Smooty caught one foot of the big man
and began pulling, Lillian Parkins leaned over
the side of her bed and hissed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let that bitch get within fifteen feet of
me! Tell Matt that examination was worse than
being looked over for a harem. If he doesn&rsquo;t get
me out of here by tomorrow night, I&rsquo;ll walk out.
Get the sailor out quietly, Snod. He loved that
dead nurse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apparently paying no attention, Snod Smooty
managed to keep the scramble loud enough to cover
Miss Parkins&rsquo; remarks.</p>
<p>He gave the sailor a little jujutsu and had him
swaying down the corridor before Miss Kerr had
found the night superintendent. They disappeared
to the sailor&rsquo;s monotone which had sunk to the note
of a child trying to lull himself to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ring aroun&rsquo; de Roshy! Rosh&rsquo;s dead. Rosh&rsquo;s
dead. Ring aroun&rsquo; de Roshy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod Smooty carried him over his shoulder down
the stairs and out of the side entrance. Upon the
curb stone he stood him against a parked automobile
and then socked him under the jaw. As he fell,
Snod opened the automobile door and laid him out
upon the back seat to sleep it off.</p>
<p>Snod&rsquo;s colorless face was tender and old. He
wanted a cigarette. Worst scene he had ever witnessed
and he&rsquo;d seen some hellbenders in his day.
But Lil was as hysterical as any of them.</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders and re-entered the
building. That was the trouble with women. They
made good detectives, where men were to be caught,
but with women...!</p>
<p class="tb">It was Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s second and blood
freezing scream that made Dr. Mattus close his
mind to his own bad heart and forget to button
his fly.</p>
<p>The piercing horror of her high agonized wail
hung over the corridor like poison gas. He tore
through it and the effort made his knees tremble.</p>
<p>What was it? What terror had entered her soul?</p>
<p>When he reached her, she was sitting bolt upright,
her weak eyes ablaze, and gazing with fixed
horror at a large bunch of American Beauty roses
which lay upon the foot of her bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>

<br />The Control</h2>
<p>Matthew Higgins laid down
<i>The Morning Call</i> and smiled vaguely. It had been
a long time since he was in the Middle West, and
you got out of the way of remembering it. He finished
his coffee, motioned for his check, paid it,
leaned over the bar and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best coffee roll I ever had outside of
Paul&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto beamed and cocked his head slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fank you! Fen I fus cum to dis country, I
vork in Paul&rsquo;s. Two vyears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt put his weight in his shoulders and his
voice was admiring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you come West?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto began wringing his towel helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, my vivfe vus humsic, so I tried to make
into a Jerman settl&rsquo;ment ... an&rsquo;....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood silent a moment. All of his verve wilted.</p>
<p>Higgins interposed, &ldquo;Any news around town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto peered over his glasses pleasantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve reever made four inchers, las&rsquo; night. Eif
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
she continuers....&rdquo; He threw out his hands. His
face flashed sober and he drew his hands over his
abdomen and said carefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Docturr Bearr Sterlink is ... dyin ... k.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt squared his shoulders and sat straight on
the stool. He stretched his torso upward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great man I guess ... that Bear Sterling!
Saved the lives of lots of people...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto reached over the counter and began carefully
balancing the dishes and his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yess. Lots. Lots of people. But even great men
half der veak spots....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Higgins poised a spoon upon the saucer
of the cup Otto was lifting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean ... &lsquo;weak spots&rsquo;...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell...,&rdquo; Otto&rsquo;s conscience and his philosophy
collided. He peered over his glasses again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Du ... did you kno&rsquo;, Docturr Bearr Sterlink?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Higgins shook his head definitely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By reputation, only. What&rsquo;s his weak spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto closed his lips completely and turned his
back. When the dishes were safely deposited, he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sum men are veak vid de knife, sum aroun&rsquo; de
heart, sum like me, aroun&rsquo; de stumack...! Sum
ven ve are young.... Sum ven ve are studients....
Sum ven ve are in bed....&rdquo; He whirled
<span class="pb" id="Page_233">233</span>
quickly and threw out his hands. His head nodded
the periods to his sentences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ve all haf dem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An interne burst through the door and begged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Otto, gimme some coffee quick! Quick, Otto!
Black!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Higgins noted the boy&rsquo;s blanched face and
shaking hands.</p>
<p>Otto soothed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fut vus hit, Docturr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The interne gulped the coffee and shook his
head pleadingly.</p>
<p>Otto leaned across the counter and ordered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fut ... frightened you, Docturr?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy put down the cup.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he strode toward the door, &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t
frightened. It was a nigger baby with a severed
head. It just got my guts ... that&rsquo;s all...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he was gone Otto turned to Matt Higgins,
shrugged and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hiss iss ... fear!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Then leaning upon the counter he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vy did <i>you</i> cum Vest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt looked him straight in the eyes and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a New York gangster, on vacation, come to
see my kid brother interning at the hospital.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Otto perked his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe ... I know him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<p>Matt Higgins shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. You couldn&rsquo;t know him. He&rsquo;s high-hat as
hell. Only lets me see him half a day every six
months.... He&rsquo;s my ... weak spot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He slid from the stool and stepped aside. Four
medical students jostled through the door.</p>
<p>Otto mopped his counter, slowly, thoughtfully,
painstakingly.</p>
<p>Matt Higgins tipped his gray hat over his narrowed
eyes, and went through the door.</p>
<p>That man knew something ... but there was
no use trying to get him to....</p>
<p>He turned down Beeker Street and made his way
over to Wilson Boulevard, one end of which was
fa&ccedil;aded by the Elijah Wilson group; the other
was bounded by the River. He looked back over his
shoulder to see if he could get a glimpse of anything
denoting the river. Only a curling line of
smoke from a ferry-boat.</p>
<p>The air was clear, still and comforting and
the people all walked like New Yorkers. But the
women didn&rsquo;t amount to much. No good legs. No
poise. No New York verve.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch as he entered the tall iron
gate and approached the main entrance. It was
eight forty-five.</p>
<p>At the main entrance he took off his gray overcoat
and stood back to let two nurses pass. They
weren&rsquo;t much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>He passed the statue of Elijah Wilson, went on
into the main corridor and turned to the left. He
walked with the air of a man who knows where he
is going and is not to be stopped by trifles. Long
experience had taught him that demeanor could
get one almost anywhere. Especially in a hospital.</p>
<p>Nurses and doctors passed, returning from
breakfast. The faces of the lovelorn and the love-lettered
were revealed by every passing window.
Intermingled with all of these were a group of
abnormally sad faces, and then he remembered that
today was the day of that nurse&rsquo;s funeral. She&rsquo;d
been a pretty little thing, too. Her fragile little
corpse had skipped rope in all of his dreams last
night! He quickened his pace and his hairy hands
were clenched in his pockets.</p>
<p>Halfway down the main corridor he stopped
ostensibly to look from a window at the back
garden of the hospital. He took in the approaching
people in both directions at a glance. They were
all of them distant enough to risk it.</p>
<p>He walked several feet further, began walking
close to the wall, and faded into a door. The door
opened into what had been the old laboratory building,
and with the renovating of the hospital had
been left vacant. The corridor was lighted by a
series of tall windows at the far end. The brilliant
morning sun sifted through them vaguely. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
grime and dust of the panes and of the intervening
corridor made its trickle thin and eerie.</p>
<p>Matthew Higgins closed the door softly and
stood silently against it for a second, listening.
Then he accustomed his eyes to the light and looked
at the floor. In the center were the tracks he and
Dr. MacArthur and Snod had made last night.
On the far side were the tracks which he and Snod
had agreed Snod should make this morning.</p>
<p>He shifted his hat upon the back of his head and
began walking up the corridor next to Snod&rsquo;s morning
tracks. Halfway up, he stopped and listened.
Then he threw his overcoat over his shoulder and
approached, cautiously, the door of the laboratory
they had decided upon. On tiptoe. Silently. His
weight was thrown forward with the expert training
of a toe-dancer. Slowly, melting into it as he
did so, he pushed open the door of the laboratory.</p>
<p>It was darker than the corridor. The outside
window blinds had been closed for several years.
He stood silently several seconds and then decided
to chance a match. He took off his hat and struck
it carefully in the shadow the hat provided. Then
when it was well-lighted he lifted it and surveyed
the room.</p>
<p>The dusty lab sinks, the rotting rubber hose,
the two stools with their cane bottoms gone, and
upon a bamboo couch in the corner Snod Smooty,
<span class="pb" id="Page_237">237</span>
his face totally devoid of expression, sleeping with
the abandon of an infant.</p>
<p>As the match burned low in his fingers Matthew
Higgins leaned over and watched Snod Smooty
sleep. This was the first time in ten years he had
known Snod to sleep with someone watching him.</p>
<p>The night must have been a swell affair! The
smell of smoke reached Smooty&rsquo;s consciousness; he
turned over suddenly and opened his eyes completely.
His face was still blank with an effort to
see in the darkness, and his voice came huskily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The answer was in keeping with the dimness.
The match had burned out and Matt Higgins was
killing it on the floor with his toe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. Wake up! Any news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod Smooty raised his slim body to a sitting
posture and slung his thin feet to the grimy floor.
He ran his left hand through his colorless hair and
wiped out his eyes with the right palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cigarette?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Higgins took <i>The Morning Call</i> from his
overcoat pocket and placed it over the hole in one
of the stools. Over that he folded his overcoat and
raised himself onto the stool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better not. Watchmen or something. How was
the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smooty put the unlit cigarette sullenly in his
hip pocket and said sweetly:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hell all the time ... and then some....
&rsquo;Bout ten a drunk naval officer-beau of the dead
nurse brought her a bouquet of red roses, darling.
Thought she was doing duty on the ward. Didn&rsquo;t
know about her death. Shook the guts outa that
student nurse when she told him and then began
playing hide-and-seek under the patients&rsquo; beds
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah, himself! I got him outa the hospital,
socked him, and tucked him into a parked car to
sleep it off. Went over him first, though. William
Brady, U. S. N. Loot. J. G.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I went back to the ward. And he had left
the roses on the bed of one old blattering fool and
she took it that she&rsquo;s next to go and can she scream!
So loud the others couldn&rsquo;t make a squeak. Well,
the Jew doctor got there and a mess of nurses and
hen medics and give them all a bromide and then
they needed bed-pans again ... and then ...
they had to have a drink of water. And then another
bed-pan around. Like salt and pepper, you
know. Now I see why the Waldorf makes money.
Pay toilets for ladies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lil?&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s voice was demanding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lil&rsquo;s lost her nerve, Matt. Swears if you don&rsquo;t
get her outa there by this afternoon, she&rsquo;s going
to walk out. Says the examination she had to get
in that damn bed was just like being frisked naked.
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
During pan-rounds we had some conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s took it into her head that that student
nurse, the niece of the head nurse, is doing the
murders. She&rsquo;s took it that the girl is like that moll
she caught in the circus last spring (she says you
know which one) working for a hypnotist and
selling dope. Damn if Lil ain&rsquo;t decided that the
head nurse of the clinic, Miss Kerr, who got her
stout old tail up there before it was all over, ain&rsquo;t
making her niece work for somebody ... ain&rsquo;t
both of them working for some control ... who
is having them murder patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord God! That ties up, too.... Go on ...
finish your story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Lil&rsquo;s idea, Matt, that they are doing it because
they hate young Sterling and are trying to
ruin him, and get him out ... and nothing I
could say ... between bed-pans and glasses of
water ... could change her mind a nits worth.
When Lil is out of reach ... you know what I
mean ... she&rsquo;s hard to reason with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she&rsquo;s got the creeps bad as the rest of
them, now, and told me if I let that little bitch
come within fifteen feet of her the rest of the night
she&rsquo;d....</p>
<p>&ldquo;So after we&rsquo;d gotten all them females quieted
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
inside and out, I had to spend till seven this A. M.
doing things that would keep me where I could see
the nurse. Sweeping corridors and asking questions
and messing up the guts of the electric refrigerator
and, you know ... having the hell of a
good time....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He threw out his hands futilely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women who can walk and talk is bad enough,
but when they ain&rsquo;t got nothing to do, except lay
out in bed ... thirty strong ... I ain&rsquo;t been
this tired since I worked in a prison camp in Germany
in &rsquo;16.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That student nurse and her aunt suspect me,
too. And I had to put up some alibi about having
been a hospital orderly in London and when I was
always in the place I was told not to be, that was
the way ... you know.... Lil says if I ain&rsquo;t
back on the ward by three this afternoon, time the
aunt usually makes floor rounds, pretending to be
learning the ways from the day orderly, she will
be outa there ... and ... you know....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work, Snod.&rdquo; Higgins complimented, and
then ordered, &ldquo;Good idea. Be back on by three.
Sleep here this morning. After last night, the
murderer will either strike quick, or lay off for
some time. I&rsquo;ll wire for another man this morning;
but he may not get here until tomorrow....
We&rsquo;ll have to do double time all around....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod&rsquo;s voice was flat and caustic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins ignored it and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you went on, MacArthur and I had another
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
talk, and he took me to see the nurse&rsquo;s body.
Lovely thing. Seems this coniine can be prepared
synthetically but the toxicologist laughs off the
idea that it was. Too hard to do. And I brought
out that however prepared the first thing to do
was to stop the &lsquo;shots&rsquo;. MacArthur agrees, but he
won&rsquo;t commit anybody. You were right. I told him
it&rsquo;s a crazy nurse or doctor and he had apoplexy.
He&rsquo;s straight. I like him. I&rsquo;m to see the heads of
all departments today and see what I can find out,
unobserved. And I&rsquo;ll meet you here again at two-forty,
before you go back on the ward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Lil&rsquo;s right, they are working for the psychiatrist,
and if she&rsquo;s not, then it&rsquo;s the man MacArthur
is shielding. See anybody last night took
your eye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They were all too shocked. The murderer
wasn&rsquo;t there.&rdquo; Smooty, who had a habit of talking
&ldquo;in character&rdquo; was too interested to &ldquo;think&rdquo; as an
orderly. &ldquo;The person in authority was the Jew and
he&rsquo;s white. Jew doctors are! Those Kerr women,
head nurse and student, took it too calmly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Want any breakfast?&rdquo; Higgins asked from the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Just a bed-pan, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod&rsquo;s voice fluted after him.</p>
<p>With the overcoat, Snod Smooty made himself
a pillow, and was asleep before Mr. Higgins had
retraced his steps halfway up the corridor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
<p>When Higgins reached the place where the basement
steps came up into the corridor of the vacant
building, he struck another match, again under
the protection of his hat and looked for the tracks
he and Dr. MacArthur had made last night. Then
he descended the steps and stood in the dark basement
corridor. He stood erect, with his shoulders
thrown back, listening. When the silence assured
his mind and hurt his eardrums he began walking
up the basement corridor, toward the entrance into
the main service corridor, which ran directly under
the main hospital corridor. He and Dr. MacArthur
had decided the best way to get out of the
lab building would be through the service corridor,
the door of which had a spring lock, and then up
the service elevator to the main floor of the Administration
Building.</p>
<p>The basement corridor was black as night, but
totally dead. The worn-out odor of old chemicals
mingled with that of damp plaster. The smell began
to permeate his nostrils and made each creak
of the sagging floor hit his brain like a pistol shot.
The soft blackness closed in like a sweating fog.</p>
<p>He began to feel as a swimmer feels against
strong tides. The door at the end of the corridor
was diminishing as the door in <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
or had it been Alice who diminished? He had
just convinced himself that the last sound and the
newest smell were caused by a leaking water tap
<span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
and an escaping gas jet, when something struck
his foot, ran up his pants&rsquo; leg to his waist, and down
the other side.</p>
<p>Rats!</p>
<p>He jumped with the agility of a fencing expert
into an open door and threw up his arm automatically.
He stood with his muscles flexed, listening and
beginning to feel the beads of perspiration starting
under his arms and trickling down his thighs.</p>
<p>And then he laughed at himself and tried to
lower his arm. It wouldn&rsquo;t come. He tugged and he
could feel his coat sleeve beginning to give. The
tap continued its regular drip, drip, and his nerves
became strung and he reached his free hand in his
pocket and drew out a match and lit it upon the
seat of his pants, regardless.</p>
<p>Then he saw the trouble instantly. His arm was
caught by a long iron hook suspended from the
ceiling. He looked around and saw the room was
full of such hooks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wuuh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ejaculation came naturally. He was in the
room where they had once hung the cadavers. His
coat was caught upon a cadaver hook! And with the
realization his reflexes began working automatically.
He leaped and freed his arm and struck his
head upon the ceiling.</p>
<p>Then he leaned against the wall and shivered.
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
The feel of the burning match against his flesh
brought him to, like a pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he muttered reprovingly and his perspiring
body was seared dry by a consuming shame.
&ldquo;Lighting matches in a basement with escaping
gas and getting hysterical over rats. Get out of
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He regained the corridor and proceeded quickly
in the direction of the door. When his hand was
upon the handle he stopped for a moment to consider
and get himself together.</p>
<p>Was Snod safe in this building? Had those feelings
he had just been through been entirely hysterical
or were they partly occasioned by the presence
of the murderer, somewhere, in that basement?</p>
<p>He checked over it all step by step and decided
that they were pure ... might as well admit it
... pure hysteria. An innate fear of dead people,
which he knew perfectly well he had had ever since
that boy in Mexico took so long to die when he shot
him fifteen years ago. And he had glassed his eyes
on him when he finally did go.</p>
<p>Nobody but Snod was in this building. A murderer
left tracks just like any other man and he
had examined all of the tracks.</p>
<p>You had to take a chance....</p>
<p>He snapped the spring lock and stepped out into
the service corridor. The door slammed behind him
and he looked both ways.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">245</div>
<p>The corridor was whitewashed and brilliantly
lighted with electric lights, like a subway station.
In the distance were two orderlies pushing two
large laundry bins. They had their backs to him.
In the other direction were three maids standing
around a woman who was talking hurriedly and
gesticulating wildly. They were standing in a knot
and did not see him. He started to walk and as he
lifted his foot it caught upon something. He looked
down.</p>
<p>He had kicked a huge bunch of American Beauty
roses from in front of the door. Somehow he side-stepped
them and began making his feet rise, fall,
and move.</p>
<p>Should he go back? Should he go on? Should he
pick them up? The great thing was to keep moving
... the great thing, and by the time he had
begun moving he had decided to ignore the flowers
... temporarily ... and try to remember MacArthur&rsquo;s
directions. Past the print shop, past the
laundry entrance, and then the first door to the
left....</p>
<p>He had accomplished the print shop when he
discovered that walking beside him was a small
faded woman, and she was carrying the roses. And
then he decided to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the main corridor of the hospital?&rdquo; He
had removed his hat and was giving her the &ldquo;somebody&rsquo;s
mother&rdquo; treatment. &ldquo;Pretty flowers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>She began to gasp out respectfully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. Take the elevator there, Doctor,&rdquo; she
pointed. &ldquo;Pretty, ain&rsquo;t they? Miss Kerr told that
maid,&rdquo; she pointed again toward a retreating figure,
&ldquo;to bring them over to the Nurses&rsquo; Home for
Miss Standish&rsquo;s funeral (she was of that simple
class which believes everybody knows her acquaintances)
and an orderly in the corridor told the
maid....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The elevator door opened and Matt Higgins
had learned all he needed to know, immediately.</p>
<p>He gave the woman his &ldquo;silver threads among
the gold&rdquo; smile and asked the elevator boy:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the main corridor above this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Lost? It&rsquo;s easy to get lost around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They reached the main floor and Matt Higgins
stepped from the elevator and began walking toward
the entrance from the main corridor to the
Administration Building.</p>
<p>He was dead tired....</p>
<p>But when he saw Dr. Henry MacArthur,
through the open door of his office, he knew that
whatever he had just been through he must hide.</p>
<p>The last man he had seen with that look of steely
panic was the president of the bank in Wall Street
during the first days of the 1929 collapse. That
kind of panic was followed by icicles of fear in the
brain and after that....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">247</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Doctor,&rdquo; his voice was calm and
confident.</p>
<p>With its tone, MacArthur&rsquo;s courtesy revived,
but it was automatic. He rose with an obvious effort
and motioned the detective to a chair, closed
the door into the corridor, and offered Higgins a
cigarette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of them noted the brilliant sun upon the
mahogany director&rsquo;s table, nor the glint it gave
the diamond upon the finger of Elijah Wilson in
the portrait hanging behind MacArthur&rsquo;s desk.</p>
<p>MacArthur re-seated himself, rubbed his eyelids
listlessly and then, his blue eyes upon Higgins&rsquo;
gray ones, asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know about last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins nodded and replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do something, Doctor. After that the
murderer will either strike immediately, or wait indefinitely.
In either case, we need a man on the
ward day as well as night. May I call the agency
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not use a local man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins shook his head decisively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too much depends on the man to take someone
I am not sure of. With your permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He reached for the telephone and MacArthur
said, &ldquo;You have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York. Digby 4-3872. Mr. Anderson.
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
James P. Anderson. Put it through right away,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held the receiver and put his hand over the
mouthpiece. Dr. MacArthur began pacing the
room. He carried himself with a brittle straightness,
and Higgins watched him closely while the
girls were saying, &ldquo;Indianapolis? Chicago? Hello
Buffalo?&rdquo; ... and then ... &ldquo;New York?&rdquo; and
then Anderson&rsquo;s voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anderson?&rdquo; Higgins knew the voice immediately.
&ldquo;Higgins. Can you get Rogers on the
Westbound mail plane in twenty minutes? Then
the other plane and he&rsquo;ll have to change at Chicago,
or charter a plane from there. Yes, shaping up.
No news yet. Good! O.K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur wheeled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins pushed the telephone over upon the
desk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he makes the plane leaving in twenty minutes.
Otherwise about eight tonight. Next to
Smooty I&rsquo;d rather have him than any man on the
force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smooty passed himself off as an orderly from
a London hospital and will go back on at three to
watch things and learn the Elijah Wilson routine
from the day orderly. So you can rest easily, as to
the vigilance, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>His voice, like his person, was strong and commanding.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur slackened his pace and Higgins
continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor, Miss Parkins thinks that the head
nurse and her niece are mediums murdering for
some control ... some doctor....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur sat down suddenly and an imperceptible
shadow of relief passed over his graven
face.</p>
<p>Last night he would have exploded at the mere
mention of such an idea, while this morning....</p>
<p>His voice was old and unconvinced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it, Higgins. I have known doctors
by the thousand. Good. Bad. And indifferent.
But I do not believe any doctor....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crazy doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur threw up his hands helplessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crazy somebody, yes. But not a doctor....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins decided to pass up the point and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever it is must be caught quickly. I suggest
we give up the idea of putting me through as a
patient. Last night it appeared feasible but I spent
most of the night thinking, and I feel certain, Doctor
MacArthur, that after the episode on the ward,
we must hasten everything. Put me through the
hospital as a member of the administrative staff
of some distant hospital. Thereby I get a chance
<span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
to see the heads of every department, including
the Psychiatrist, and the Physician-in-Chief....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur winced. Then that was the man!
Higgins continued, placidly, &ldquo;And decide who I
must question, and also permit me ... if necessary
... to get about the hospital suddenly.
After last night....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur interrupted him. His panic was
welling up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll agree to anything ... almost, Mr. Higgins.
After last night action is vital. Tomorrow is
visiting day throughout the hospital. By tomorrow
night relatives of every patient on that ward
will know that Rose Standish was murdered! And
we cannot avoid their knowing it. If we close the
ward to visitors ... we have never in all the
years the hospital has been in existence done ...
that! Public confidence is our greatest asset. Has
been. What shall we do? The newspapers, the police,
the reputation of the hospital, d&rsquo;y&rsquo;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too well, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the tension was wearing itself out in speech
and Dr. MacArthur went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hysteria among the nursing and medical
staffs was bad enough, God knows, but before today
is over, we must face the hysteria manifesting
itself among the menial staff. How can a hospital
run without orderlies, electricians, cooks? If the
menials become hysterical...?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>&ldquo;They already are, Doctor. When I came out
of the basement entrance of the old lab building
into the service corridor fifteen minutes ago, my
feet caught upon a bunch of red roses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, sir, my feet caught....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard you. Where did they come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had been dropped, Doctor, by a maid
who had been ordered by Miss Kerr, the head nurse
in Medicine Clinic, to take them over to the Nurses&rsquo;
Home for the funeral of Miss Standish. An orderly
told the maid where they came from....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The panic re-entered Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s eyes and
Higgins took advantage of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right about time, Doctor. It&rsquo;s everything.
To save time I must have every atom of
knowledge which you have. Last night I hoped to
work independently, but now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward and shot his gimlet gray
eyes into the horror stricken ones of MacArthur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the man everybody but you suspects, young
Sterling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur&rsquo;s groan was evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I thought so. Last night you suggested
I question him last on account of his father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>MacArthur&rsquo;s fight seemed suddenly to return
and he shot back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This morning I demand it. His father will be
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
dead by midnight. I appreciate your position, but
I must ask you to respect my wishes. Have you
given up the idea that Bear Sterling is implicated?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir. But we cannot await another murder
to clear him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely. Nor anybody else, Mr. Higgins. I
see that. But I also see that if Cub Sterling does
not leave his father&rsquo;s side today and is not questioned
until after his death, supposing ... the
other ... to be correct ... you will have not
lost anything. They must all be checked, automatically,
since you believe the murderer is a crazy
doctor. Check them today, Mr. Higgins. And
if....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose and began to pace the floor, and his
figure was more than erect. It was almost illuminated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You belong, sir, to that type of man which can
appreciate trust between strong men. Between Cub
Sterling and his father such a trust has always
existed. Within twenty hours it will be broken and
... why, Mr. Higgins, if you wish, I shall sit
outside the door of the room in which he is fighting
for Bear&rsquo;s life, from now until you release me....
But my position ... d&rsquo;y&rsquo;see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, and I respect you for it, Doctor. But the
two men who have attended all of the dead patients
were the Doctors Sterling. Regarding the questioning,
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
I shall do as you desire, provided, sir, that
when the superintendent of nurses takes me to
Medicine Clinic, you will insist that Dr. Cub Sterling
accompany us over the clinic, in precisely the
same manner in which the other men are to do.
Thereby I can at least judge the man. Otherwise
I throw up the case, here and now. My position
would be hopeless, if I were to be denied at least
a summary ... not made through the eyes of
personal esteem and family fame ... of one of
the two chief suspects. Perhaps it is brutal to put
it so, but the chief suspect in the eyes of the nursing
and menial staffs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it, Higgins. I&rsquo;ll do as you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice and his face were parched and sad.</p>
<p>Their eyes locked again and Higgins said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You brought me here to find the criminal. In
many things we shall have to fight each other.
Mainly because all evidence points to a crazy doctor
and you cannot accept the evidence. Somehow
I&rsquo;m glad you can&rsquo;t, Doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins stretched out his large hairy hand and
Dr. MacArthur gripped it firmly.</p>
<p>Then MacArthur looked at his watch and
reached for the telephone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superintendent of nurses, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carruthers? Dr. MacArthur. Will you
please come over to my office immediately?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>As he hung up, he seemed to have regained his
old authoritative manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Miss Standish&rsquo;s funeral. Do you think
it worth your while to attend? Would a murderer
of this type go to the funeral of a person he had
murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly, Doctor. What time is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four-fifteen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Kerrs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have both asked to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were interrupted by a knock upon the door
and the figure of Miss Carruthers.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur rose and smiled her into a chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I present Mr. Immerheld, Miss Carruthers.
He is on the administrative staff of the Cornell
Medical Centre, and I want him to see the Elijah
Wilson. He came unexpectedly and this morning I
am upset about Dr. Sterling. Mr. Immerheld used
to know Dr. Sterling ... and understands....
Will you please take him around, and see that he
sees the heads of all clinics? Cornell has been very
kind about approving our rebuilding plans and
Mr. Immerheld has been a great prop ... to the
hospital. His advice....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss. Carruthers smiled politely at Matthew Higgins,
and rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be delighted, Dr. MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice, body and face were brittle, and at
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
the same time authoritative. She was the spun-glass
skeleton of what had been a buxomly commanding
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I leave my hat, Doctor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins rose and stood beside Miss Carruthers;
as he opened the door, he gave her the &ldquo;silver
threads among the gold&rdquo; look and she took it as
sand does water.</p>
<p>Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s voice halted their pleasant
unity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Miss Carruthers. Will you be so
good as to telephone Miss Kerr just before you go
to Medicine Clinic? I am especially anxious for
Mr. Immerheld to meet Ethridge Sterling. Go
over the building with him. He knew Dr. Bear
when he was....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice faded and hers filled the gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Dr. MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And as they started up the corridor, her words
floated back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a great teaching hospital, Mr. Immerheld,
the Elijah Wilson has always....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been free from crazy doctors.&rdquo; Dr. MacArthur
thought and his hands pounded his desk ...
hopelessly.</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;What are you smoothing my bed for?&rdquo; Lil
Parkins&rsquo; voice was irritable. She had been awake
for twenty hours now and her nerves were fraying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rounds.&rdquo; Miss Kexter, the day white nurse,
was brisk and snappish. These murders were beginning
to get on her nerves. Not that she was
scary. Or that she had liked Rose Standish. But
just the same, those roses against her face, when
she had gone to breakfast, and gone up to &ldquo;look
at her,&rdquo; left the stomach kind of.... And then
&ldquo;Foots&rdquo; Kerr was trying to behave....</p>
<p>Lil Parkins looked her over casually and decided
that she was out of it. Spineless as a stick of cooked
macaroni and ... and....</p>
<p>The conversation in the ward had died and all
of the women were either sitting or lying respectfully
still. Dr. Cub Sterling, Dr. Mattus had telephoned,
was going to leave his dying father and
come down to see how they were.</p>
<p>The lull was welcome to Lil Parkins and she felt,
suddenly, for a few hours at least, she was safe and
free to just relax a little.</p>
<p>She awoke to find a tall, angular man with bushy
hair leaning over her and saying, &ldquo;Pretty fair.
Considering. Strengthened in the night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jew doctor, who had admitted her, stood beside
the tall man whose left shoulder was cocked
at a queer angle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good bit, Dr. Sterling. When she came in....&rdquo;
he slid off into medical terms and Lil Parkins&rsquo; face
took on one of its flashes of sudden intensity and
Cub Sterling&rsquo;s responded. His response was slow
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
and he was tired, but his eyes were gorgeous and
his hands were soothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty tired, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was put in the voice one used with
a social equal and Lil Parkins knew she really
liked him. He recognized that she wasn&rsquo;t just &ldquo;another
free patient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your name come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had straightened up and stood at the foot of
her bed looking kindly into her eyes. With a supreme
effort, Lil knew that she must manage to
act, really act!</p>
<p>She shook her head slowly, and her face faded
blank again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will,&rdquo; he said confidently. &ldquo;What you needed
was rest. How did you get that scar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed to one halfway up her left forearm
and Lil, mesmerized by his eyes, actually told the
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the circus. Trapeze work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that heart!&rdquo; his voice carried both reprimand
and admiration, &ldquo;What circus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ringling Brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The heart case two beds up was sitting boldly
erect. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say? An old trouper! Well, I&rsquo;ll
be doggone! Ringling Brothers, too! Top-notcher
ain&rsquo;t you, kid? Is Fred Bradna still ringmaster?
How far out did you get last year? Playing Texas
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
this spring? Is Old Bill, the bull elephant, you
know ... still alive...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Cub Sterling laughed spontaneously and
every woman in the ward smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to wait till she&rsquo;s better. And then
she&rsquo;ll remember everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was crisp and final. The other doctors
had passed on and were discussing Mrs. Witherspoon&rsquo;s
condition. Cub Sterling joined them, but
he turned suddenly and smiled into the limpid,
waiting eyes of Lil Parkins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to sleep!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His lips formed the words noiselessly, and her
tension snapped and her eyes began to close, listlessly.</p>
<p>Cub started toward Room Two. Mattus&rsquo; voice
halted his steps. Mattus said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s all right, Doctor! Slept clear through
it! I just saw her ten minutes ago. Your father&rsquo;s
latest tank of oxygen is half gone, sir. Do you
wish me...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub nodded silently and walked down the corridor
toward the waiting elevator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<h2 id="c9">&raquo;IX&laquo;
<br />The Third Doll</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Roll &rsquo;em up, Snod! Time to get up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod opened his eyelids narrowly and then
closed them again. He began experimenting slowly
with his head, burying his chin in his long neck
and stretching his shoulder muscles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any news?&rdquo; his voice was still somnambulant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lots! Got your wits about you?&rdquo; Matt Higgins
began pulling himself up on one of the stools
and his voice was grating. The old deserted laboratory
building was on the side of the hospital where
no afternoon sun ever penetrated. It was now inky
black in the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where do you think my wits would be? In this
feather bed?&rdquo; Snod replied sarcastically, raising
himself to a sitting posture, and rubbing his aching
neck with his hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stinks like a skunk in here!&rdquo; Snod stood up
carefully and walked toward one of the dusty lab
sinks. He turned on the tap and stuck his head
under it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men have it over women in lots of ways,&rdquo; he
<span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
said as he took his handkerchief from his pocket
and wiped his dripping face. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the dope,
Matt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you went back to sleep I went to MacArthur
and he was as frightened as an old maid in
a harem. All up in the air ... hundreds of feet.
Said tomorrow is visiting day throughout the hospital
and that it will be all over town by tomorrow
night about the nurse being murdered and that
after last night ... you know ... the-you-you-must-do-something
line....</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I made him come across with all he knew and
sent for Rogers. He&rsquo;ll be here by six on the mail
plane or eight via Chicago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man everybody but MacArthur suspects
is young Sterling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hell you say!&rdquo; Snod continued placidly
waving his wet handkerchief in the dead air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yep. I&rsquo;ve seen him and he&rsquo;s not guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh? Howd&rsquo;y&rsquo;know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing concrete. Except he took me over his
building. Left his dying father at MacArthur&rsquo;s request,
because I was supposed to be a friend of the
old man. He&rsquo;s worried, jumpy, nervous as a cat
locked up, but he&rsquo;s square or I&rsquo;m a ninny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been one a long time, Matt. Still, if he&rsquo;s
where we can keep an eye on him, just in case a real
unbiased detective, like me, for instance, should
disagree with you, I suppose we&rsquo;d better not tell
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
Lil. If she ain&rsquo;t improved since this morning, she
might do a real fade-out, and then where&rsquo;d we be,
with MacArthur pressing for immediate action?
In hell! Who else charmed the pants off you, mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shut up, Snod. We&rsquo;ve only twenty minutes before
you go back on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod groaned deeply. &ldquo;A light luncheon, before
I again enter the dominion of women?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eat out of the ward refrigerator and shut up!</p>
<p>&ldquo;MacArthur gave me the head of all nurses, the
leavings of a general gone senile, and she took me
to all of the clinics. So I could look the doctors
over. Administrator from a distant hospital line,
you know.... I&rsquo;ve hammered into MacArthur
that it&rsquo;s a crazy doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you find one, Sherlock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see anything else! Crazy ain&rsquo;t the beginning
of it! First we took in the Eye Clinic, all
the wards dark and dismal and the air full of unuttered
screams, and people putting their hands up
close to their faces to see if they are better.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s run by an old soft soap artist with hair
and complexion like the guts of a soft-boiled egg.
Pure and precious. Pat the tail off a Shetland pony
and grab out your eye &rsquo;fore you knew it. Peters.
Doctah Petahhs. Princeton &rsquo;92 and Sons of Cincinnati
rosette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your control?&rdquo; Snod&rsquo;s voice was casual and
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
flat. &ldquo;Snappin&rsquo; out eyes gets a man in the habit of
murdering, Mr. Higgins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw hush, you little pan-toter. He&rsquo;d run from a
Pansy in a dark alley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So would I.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From there,&rdquo; Higgins&rsquo; voice was stern, &ldquo;we
went on to see the kids. The pediatrician&rsquo;s square.
Eyes like a searchlight. Kids play around him.
Kids and dogs know. He does not suspect Sterling,
and he knew I was a detective. He didn&rsquo;t say
either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t anybody utter a word this morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snod! Gimme a chance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Birds of a feather ... you sound as loony as
the rest, Matt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew Higgins flew off the handle. The darkness
concealed his steely eyes, but his voice was
clear and hard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you telling me, or am I telling you? Ever
been in a slaughter house where they were doing
everything from little pigs ... on up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, Matt. Might have known it would get
you! The trouble with you is you are up against
the medical profession, and the medical profession
is composed of men who wait until you are down
to hit you, and you ain&rsquo;t used to....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they queer, Snod? I didn&rsquo;t see but two
he-men this morning, and I saw at least ten doctors,
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
and about half of that ten, I&rsquo;d be damned if I could
tell you what they was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Statistics show that one-third of the silk underwear
sold in the United States is bought by doctors.&rdquo;
Snod was grave and authoritative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They buy it for the nurses!&rdquo; Snod continued
monotonously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw ... dry up! ... From the kids we went
to the Maternity Clinic, and speaking of he-she
things! Well he wore pants and a vest, but he talked
like a nervous wife of fifty and his hands were always
twisting....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. A rat catcher!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They call him Prissy. How did you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he believes Sterling is the murderer,&rdquo;
Snod announced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, you been sleeping all morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. But I&rsquo;m a real detective. An obstetrician
is the busiest animal on God&rsquo;s earth. He don&rsquo;t have
time to change his undershirt. Any woman can call
him at any hour, and what do you expect from a
man in that fix but gossip, mister? &rsquo;Spose you spent
your life....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, naw!&rdquo; Matt&rsquo;s response was definite. &ldquo;He
and Peters are buddies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sissies. It takes guts to fight death, and skill to
be a doctor. Guts is masculine, skill is feminine.
They&rsquo;re sissies.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>&ldquo;It takes more than that to be a urologist, Snod.
The one here holds out in a clinic where you see
men ... Jesus! ... The damnedest looking
liquids suspended over the beds hitched under the
sheets with rubber tubing and patients who curse
your soul black if you so much as sneeze as you
pass them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the ball is over,&rdquo; Snod inserted flatly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, believe me, that doctor is all man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have to be. Urologists rule men and men rule
the world, Mr. Higgins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah? He believes young Sterling is innocent,
and he knew I was &lsquo;a dick&rsquo; the minute he laid eyes
on me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how do you know that? Personal charm?
Or just &lsquo;two strong men face to face&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins ignored the remark and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Offered me a good cigar, and looked me smack
in the eye, and then says, &lsquo;A friend of Doctor MacArthur
and Dr. Bear Sterling is always welcome
in my clinic, sir.&rsquo; He&rsquo;s the bird made MacArthur
hire us against the opposition, or I&rsquo;m a green one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are that, too. But you are right about him.
Everything comes to a G. U. including &lsquo;dicks&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandmother told me. What about the
psychiatrist?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever faced one of those birds?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<p>Snod had felt his way back to the couch and sat
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope, but I seen &rsquo;em telling fortunes at Coney
Island.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You crazy? This fellow here is &rsquo;bout ten thousand
jumps from a tent. Got a building with swimming
pools, and roof gardens and woodwork
painted green and locks on all the doors....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a staff of old maid nurses and unmarried
women doctors, who are always telling you &lsquo;sex
done it.&rsquo; Night-prowling alley cats, at heart. What
about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His name is Hoffbein, and he&rsquo;s got a little body
like the tripod of a camera, without the stiffening,
holding up his mentality. Got a head like a German.
All front, with oriental black eyes, a controlled
sissy mouth, a beaky nose, and no back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He slithered all over the clinic with us, and God
that was gruesome! Perfectly healthy people, eating
saltpetre in their food and wondering how long
before they&rsquo;d be nuts! And him saying, &lsquo;Routine,
as you of course know, is the basis of all recovery.&rsquo;
And way down below a voice wailing &lsquo;Rock-a-bye-baby.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t a man, he ain&rsquo;t just a sissy, he ain&rsquo;t
even a human being. If you put a bullet through
him, it wouldn&rsquo;t even kill him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;s the thing we got to catch. He&rsquo;s it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s so crazy that you ain&rsquo;t sure whether he&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
crazy or not. He&rsquo;s the control. He&rsquo;s the person who
is working the Kerr women and Lil is right. And
he knows I know it, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charm it out of you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I&rsquo;d seen the Surgical Clinic, and was always
trying to ask intelligent questions about costs
and that kind of thing to the man who is Bear Sterling&rsquo;s
assistant, Miss Carruthers took me to Cub
Sterling and I told you about him. But I saw the
Head Nurse, Miss Kerr, too. And then I knew I
was right. Seen her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night. During the Battle of Roses.&rdquo; Snod&rsquo;s
reply came through the darkness with confirmation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I ditched Miss Carruthers and went back
to the Psychiatric Clinic and into Hoffbein&rsquo;s office
before anybody realized I was there. He was sitting
in a room with bare walls, at a bare desk, and
when he looked up and saw me, he almost lost his
&lsquo;control.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks up and his eyes lost their whites like
a horse, and he says slow, &lsquo;So.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yep!&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I walked over and sat down in a chair
beside his desk, and we looked at each other and he
tried to make me feel like the furniture in the room
was melting and running together and so I says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I know the multiplication tables well as Kim
did, Doc. The last person who tried that hypnotizing
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
stunt on me was the head of a snowbird ring at
Atlantic City. She is making dresses in the Federal
Pen in Atlanta, now. What about Miss Kerr?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned red like a cooked beet and then he
switched his head like a sparrow and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Miss Kerr is a nurse in this hospital and a very
trusted person. Your name? Real name?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t matter a tinker&rsquo;s damn, Doc! Miss Kerr
was a patient of yours some years ago and you used
to hypnotize her to put her to sleep and this doll,
the doll which is always left by the murderer in
Medicine Clinic, was found in her desk and you
knew it yesterday. What about Miss Kerr?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looked kind of scared a minute and then he
turned on me confidentially and says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;If you want my opinion, Mr..., these unfortunate
occurrences are the work of Dr. Sterling,
Junior. An excellent example of a man who has
devoted the best years of his active life entirely to
his profession. To speak plainly, sexual abstinence
has caused an inversion of that natural energy by
which a man obtains his balance, and is responsible
for his aberration. When a man devotes himself
entirely to any profession he in time becomes somewhat
unbalanced. If you understand...?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You bet I do, Dr. Hoffbein. You are in a rotten
position, and all the evidence you have been
trying to build up against young Sterling in every
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
staff meeting for a week won&rsquo;t hold water <i>fifteen
minutes</i> if you can&rsquo;t explain to me by four o&rsquo;clock
about the doll....&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He stiffened and replied: &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to Miss
Standish&rsquo;s funeral.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;See you there, then,&rsquo; I said, rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the door I turned and his eyes were spraying
venom on me like a snake&rsquo;s fangs, and he says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What patients tell me in confidence, I will
never....&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Reveal on the gallows,&rsquo; I finished slowly.
&lsquo;Think it over, Doctor! You&rsquo;ll be guarded till you
make up your mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shut the door, hard, and came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is watching him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A local man the dick at the Roosevelt got me.
It&rsquo;s five to three. You&rsquo;d better be moving....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod rose slowly. &ldquo;Where are you going? What
shall I tell Lil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To scare the guts out of the Kerr women. Tell
Lil she&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod left the building by the basement door and
started up the service corridor toward the Medicine
Clinic. Matt Higgins rolled his overcoat carefully
in the crumpled copy of <i>The Morning Call</i>,
hid it in a corner of the room and left the building
by the main corridor door. Since it was three o&rsquo;clock
and the duty changes were at two and five, he took
a chance....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>By two-thirty the patients on Ward B had been
bedded down for their afternoon nap. Two student
nurses were on duty. Miss Kexter was off for the
afternoon.</p>
<p>Sally Ferguson lay in her bed, her arms locked
above her head, her knees crossed and making a
tent of the covers. She was smoking her last cigarette,
inhaling slowly and gazing from the window.
She had slept all night, a loggy black sleep, and
was fatigued and internally trembly. A boredom, a
lassitude and a loneliness were descending.</p>
<p>An overpowering desire to see Cub, backed by
a hundred residents and internes, if necessary ...
just to watch his eyes change and slip over hers
... to see again, even at a distance, the nice way
the black hair grew below his white cuffs and over
the knuckles of his fingers ... to hear from his
own lips that, &ldquo;Doctor Bear Sterling is doing
nicely, thank you&rdquo; ... instead of having it
smirked by prim nurses....</p>
<p>The ash-laden tip fell upon the covers. She
flounced them and decided even if his father died,
even if <i>The Call</i> was bombed, she had Cub forever
and he had her and they both knew it, and life was
going to be complete ... yet!</p>
<p>The door to her room breathed gently inward. A
man wiggled through and closed it. For a moment
he stood entirely silent, then his beady black eyes
snapped and his bumpy body relaxed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>The rush of asthmatic air made Sally slide her
eyes and gasp:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jumbo! Where did you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her voice relaxed into amusement and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an angel from God. Give me a cigarette!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without withdrawing his thumbs from his vest
armholes, he pushed two fingers into a pocket and
flipped his cigarette case onto the bed.</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s eyes narrowed. Jumbo had a spell of his
&ldquo;scoop hysterics.&rdquo; Something was up! She lit the
new cigarette and remained silent.</p>
<p>The words splashed out of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell of a time getting in. No visitors. You ain&rsquo;t
lookin&rsquo; sick, Ferg. Sneaked up the porch stairs.
Half hour stomach travel and five minutes walking.
I ain&rsquo;t got time to ask polite questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, Ferg. You been here long enough to
get the dope. What is it? Come on, kid! What about
this Cub Sterling? Bucks wants to....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally kept his eyes on her body and fought for
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bucks. In case you&rsquo;ve forgot, Ferg, he&rsquo;s City
Editor of <i>The Call</i> and saving six columns on the
front page for this Sterling story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally took the cigarette from her lips and said
crisply:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">271</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you quit bubbling, Jumbo, and tell
me what it&rsquo;s all about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About. Je-sus Christ, Ferg. About! It&rsquo;s about
this guy Sterling murdering patients in that ward
out there. Bucks says you&rsquo;ve had time to get &lsquo;in&rsquo;
and it&rsquo;s up to you to get the dots on him. Four
people gone out in the same bed since Thursday.
All patients of his. Done between eleven and twelve
at night. He jabbed &rsquo;em with a hypodermic. For
four days we&rsquo;ve known hell had burst loose up here,
but we couldn&rsquo;t squeeze blood from no tick. Then
this morning a woman dropped a bunch of red
roses in the service corridor and we got a tip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Attorney-General&rsquo;s trying to get the Governor
to &lsquo;hush&rsquo; it ... but Bucks says he can fry
his tail in hell. It&rsquo;s the biggest story west of the
Mississippi in twenty years and he ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to
lock those presses &rsquo;till ten tonight. In the meantime
you got to....&rdquo;</p>
<p>As usual when excited, Jumbo walked up and
down and did not look at the person he was addressing.
That habit gave Sally time to take the shock
before he turned.</p>
<p>She held the cigarette between her lips to keep
them from trembling. Her feet were flat upon the
mattress, pressing against each other desperately.
Her voice was hail-fellow and confident. She said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks for the chance you and Bucks are giving
me. It&rsquo;s white! Darned white! And lucky, too,
<span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
Jumbo. He&rsquo;s my doctor. Due to come to see me in
about half an hour. You go back and tell Bucks
to give me till five. It&rsquo;s now a quarter to three. I&rsquo;ll
get the story! Gimme a pencil and some paper.
Beat it, before somebody comes in...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Bucks said....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You tell Bucks Hammond if he wants this story,
he&rsquo;ll get it ... provided he gives me a little time.
I know the ropes around here. I know the man. The
only way to muff it is for you to stand there till
you&rsquo;re caught! Quit sucking your tongue like a
lolly-pop and beat it. If you are not back by five
I&rsquo;ll wrap my story in a cake of soap and sling it
out that window!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jumbo tripped to the door, turned and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a swell kid, Ferg! Everybody&rsquo;s missin&rsquo;
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been one twenty-four years! Tell &rsquo;em hello,
Jumbo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After he was gone Sally Ferguson pulled the
sheets over her head and sobbed dryly for five minutes.
Then she tiptoed over to the washbasin, put
cold water under her eyes and got back into bed.</p>
<p>Her mouth was set. Her head was very high.</p>
<p>He was as innocent as she was and ... by God
... she&rsquo;d prove it. But you couldn&rsquo;t prove anything
lying here being policed every pulse counting.
You had to get out and think and....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">273</div>
<p>She rang her bell; when the student nurse came,
she smiled wanly and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Mattus and Dr. Sterling said I might get
up for a while this afternoon. Will you bring me
my clothes now? They said from three to five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl drank the smile. When she returned
with the clothes she apologized:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you manage alone, Miss Merriweather?
The other nurse has the cramps and doesn&rsquo;t want
to report off duty, less she has to. So I&rsquo;m doing most
of...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; Sally smiled. &ldquo;Poor kid!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned from the door and said, &ldquo;Ring
if you need me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A terrible strength began to flow through Sally.
A strength which centered just under the skin and
left her vitals hollow and quivering. It took ten
precious minutes to dress. Inside, and with every
motion of pulling on stockings, adjusting garters,
smoothing her hair, inside, deep inside, her consciousness
sang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub Sterling, you are not! You are not! Cub
darling, I love you! I love you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deep singing was like a walking cane as she
started across the room for the door. She pulled
the knob, hesitantly, ascertained the student nurse
was out of sight, and gathering all of her strength,
ran the few feet to the screen porch door. When her
knees gave way she was on the concrete steps, halfway
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
down to Ward A, and Ward A was the ground
floor.</p>
<p>A wild mental clearing made her understand
that with or without strength, she had to reach
that porch off Ward A, get over the railing and
drop to the ground, before the nurses began rolling
the patients out for their afternoon airing.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, a young girl, walking with
an erectness every motion of which hurt, entered
Otto&rsquo;s restaurant and leaned against the deserted
bar.</p>
<p>She fastened her violet eyes into Otto and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love Cub Sterling as much as you do. I think
I can save him ... if you&rsquo;ll lend me a dollar for
two hours....&rdquo;</p>
<p>The money was in her hand before Otto could
open his lips. When he did open them, the girl was
already in a taxi-cab, and the cab was coasting
down the hill from the hospital.</p>
<p class="tb">When Miss Carruthers, in response to a telephone
call, brought Evelina Kerr, student nurse,
to Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s office, Matt Higgins rose from
a chair and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Carruthers, Dr. MacArthur just stepped
out a minute.... He asked me to wait until he
returned and ask you to please let this nurse...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His &ldquo;silver threads&rdquo; smile brought an immediate
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
acquiescence. The old lady smiled, backed out, and
Higgins offered the student nurse a chair.</p>
<p>She sat upon the edge, her narrow feet together
and the bony ankles pressing against each other.
Higgins offered her a cigarette. Her refusal was
jerky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said walking toward the door.
&ldquo;My mistake. I don&rsquo;t want to get you thrown out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flinched slightly and her round chin tried
for a well-bred hauteur. It missed.</p>
<p>When the door was closed, Higgins looked
squarely, slowly, with open summary, at the girl.
She thought he was flirting. When his eyes began
their spreading lid trick, she felt as though he
were pointing the muzzle of a pistol toward her.
She tried to fight his silence with words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you? Why are you looking at me that
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins laid his head against the door. His lids
continued widening.</p>
<p>Her words beat the air:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop looking at me! Stop it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were like an ice cloth against her
brain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you quit lying, girlie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The battle was uneven. Perfect physical control
against shattered nerves. Her close-set eyes began
to ferret. She made a last effort to hide behind her
sex.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lying. I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking
about! You are crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt&rsquo;s eyes stayed steadfast. He said very
slowly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No ... it&rsquo;s your aunt who is crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her beaten nerves threw the battle back to her
body. She leaped to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not. She&rsquo;s not! I swear to God she&rsquo;s not!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins walked over and clenched his hands
into her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fought to get loose.</p>
<p>He increased, gradually, his hold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look ... at ... me...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her piglike eyes cringed before his steel ones.</p>
<p>Quickly, unexpectedly, he released his hold and
smiled at her. His voice was deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kiddo, I&rsquo;m sorry for you. Sit down!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She fell into a chair and began dry-sobbing. He
filled a glass from the thermos jug on the mantel
and placed it against her lips. And while she drank,
with his free hand he soothed her ugly little forehead
as one soothes a terrified child.</p>
<p>Kindness was the one thing the girl had never
known. She couldn&rsquo;t fence against it.</p>
<p>Higgins&rsquo; reasoning voice suggested:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He took the glass and set it upon the table. Then
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
he took her sweating hand and held it protectingly
in his.</p>
<p>The words cascaded out of her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not killing them! I swear to God she&rsquo;s not!
She&rsquo;s ... she&rsquo;s ... I can&rsquo;t tell you ... she&rsquo;ll
have me thrown out.... I can&rsquo;t! I can&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins put his other hand beneath the hand he
was already holding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; he ordered in a monotone....
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes picked into the shady depths of her
close-set ones. He smiled again....</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s terror fell away. She whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s ... taking ... morphia-off-the-ward-I&rsquo;m-on-in-her-clinic.
At night. Between the supervisor&rsquo;s
rounds!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither the pressure of his hands nor his voice
changed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For herself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she an...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s whisper was almost inaudible....</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... I ... think ... so....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins&rsquo; voice became stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how do you know she&rsquo;s not ... the murderer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl shot back instantly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she ... didn&rsquo;t come until I notified
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
her ... the night ... the nurse ... went
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you didn&rsquo;t see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her words came in gasps:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ... I ... counted-the-tablets ... when-I-came-on
... duty ... and-when-I-went-off.
They ... checked...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps she didn&rsquo;t take any to throw you off
the track. Had you thought of...?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The terror in her eyes and voice made Matt
shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word was a wail.</p>
<p>He changed his tactics immediately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not likely, though. When the urge is
&lsquo;on&rsquo;, nothing ... not even murder ... can stop
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had risen while he was talking and opened
the door into the corridor. Ten minutes had passed.
Dr. MacArthur entered. Higgins said to the girl:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have nothing more to worry about. Dr.
MacArthur and Miss Carruthers will stand behind
you ... till you graduate!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he went out of the Administration Building,
down the main corridor of the hospital. The
corridor was nearly empty. In the distance five probationers,
with new text books under their arms,
were coming toward him, but they were the only
people in sight. The wards had settled down for
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
the afternoon, the white nurses were off duty, and
two student nurses on each floor and the head nurse
of each building were on duty. The internes and
resident were doing lab or case studies.</p>
<p>After he rounded the corner and started toward
Medicine Clinic, he met more people and an air
of increased tension. The tension was especially
plain in the orderlies and maids. He remembered
that he had forgotten to tell Snod about the roses,
and considered going up to Ward B after he entered
Medicine Clinic, then decided to let it slip.
That would be dangerous. Even though he had his
group cornered there was no reason to take unnecessary
chances.</p>
<p>Good thing he had spent part of last evening
checking up on Miss Kerr&rsquo;s past. Now that he had
the dope information....</p>
<p>Lil Parkins was the best woman he had ever
worked with. She smelt people like a dog. Kind of
sixth sense and she never missed. Her hunches had
made his reputation.</p>
<p>The explosive air hung over him like a pall.
Through an open door he could see Miss Roenna
Kerr, her flat feet primly under her desk, her white
pompadour overhanging her lean face....</p>
<p>He walked straight into her office and closed the
door behind him. Her pen dropped from her fingers
and she turned her long head. Then her face became
as devoid of expression as a mule&rsquo;s. Panicky
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
and blank with fear. But her long years of training
came briskly to her aid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do for you? Is there something in
the Clinic that you failed to see, Mr. Immerheld?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not Mr. Immerheld of Cornell Medical
Center, Miss Kerr. I am from New York, though,
and you can be so good as to tell me,&rdquo; his gray eyes
narrowed and tried to make her china blue ones
rise above his necktie, &ldquo;how you happened to have
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He drew from his back pocket the doll in the blue
dress and frilled bonnet, that Mattus had found
in Miss Kerr&rsquo;s desk, and turned it over on its stomach.</p>
<p>The raucous, &ldquo;Pa-pa! Pa-pa! Pa-pa!&rdquo; kept repeating
itself slowly and insistently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn it over! Turn it over! I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; there
was relief in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My niece had a <span class="sc">P. M.</span> several ... about ...
a week ago ... and went to a street fair and won
it. She brought it to me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins seated himself carefully in a chair beside
her desk and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour ago the doll that your niece won
was lying in her top bureau drawer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without intending to do so, her china blue eyes
raised to his and he shot past her protective covering
into her unprepared ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is morphia quicker than cocaine?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p>From inside, without intention, she answered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she realized what she had said and opened
her lips to make a statement about &ldquo;depending
upon the condition of the patient....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins did not allow her to utter the words.
Once an addict has acknowledged the habit, he
knew she was powerless to refrain from talking
about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the shot you use?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An eighth used to do. It&rsquo;s a half now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hands began to flutter wildly. Higgins
turned the doll over again. Its nasal whining raised
the electric tension.</p>
<p>His voice cut through the whining. He said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was clever of you not to take any tablets the
night you did the nurse....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t! Before God, I <i>didn&rsquo;t do</i>....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like Cub Sterling, do you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question shot at her like a bullet. She staggered
internally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Hoffbein doesn&rsquo;t like him, either! Dr. Hoffbein
used to put you to sleep after...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After what?&rdquo; she defied and cowered at the
same time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that woman doctor you lived with died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not so. How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Hoffbein.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">282</div>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t tell you either. He just called
me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s in your case history, then....&rdquo;
He leaned quickly forward. &ldquo;Why did you hide the
doll?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To protect my niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He changed his tactics:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you use your own syringe on the nurse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman&rsquo;s facial muscles contracted. Her
yellow teeth laid bare against her purpling lips.
Her bust relaxed hopelessly and then she began to
talk, openly, helplessly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do the nurse. Really, I didn&rsquo;t. I didn&rsquo;t
do any of them! ... I ... I ... was ...
there ... Monday ... but....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did ... them ... if you didn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her china eyes protruded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One ... one of ... the Cub Sterling&rsquo;s!!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words bit through her old teeth:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two of them! ... Two...!
... Two Cub Sterlings...! I <i>saw</i> them that
night ... of the first traceable murder Monday
night! ... I was coming out of the Medicine
Closet with my ... and one of them was bending
over the patient in Bed 11, and one of them was
shadowed against the window shade bending over
the patient in Room Two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the one ... bending over the patient in
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
Bed 11 ...&rdquo; her words began to burst ... &ldquo;<i>saw
me</i>! I know <i>he saw me</i>! ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins cut in sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your duty to ... investigate....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her hands began to pick her bosom wildly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t.... I couldn&rsquo;t.... Don&rsquo;t you
see I couldn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell Dr. Hoffbein...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because ... because ... he had said if
... I ever went back ... to my ... habit
... on duty....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins nodded grimly and hunched forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who around this hospital looks like Cub Sterling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody! I swear nobody! Oh, God, I&rsquo;ve been
over every single face since then ... in my mind
... and on sight.... Nobody!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One of those Cub Sterlings was a man who knew
you were taking dope, Miss Kerr ... who knew
that when you saw him ... you&rsquo;d keep your
mouth shut. Who knew...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody but ... my ... niece! That&rsquo;s why
I took the doll. To keep the Staff from ... grilling
her ... I was afraid....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are missing out somewhere. Who checks
the dope?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The floor nurse, once a month. She gives the
sheet to me and I turn the clinic sheets over to the
pharmacy....&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the pharmacy! They knew, Miss Kerr!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! They didn&rsquo;t know. I ... I ...
changed ... the sheet from Ward B ... the
day I turned it in ... so as to cover....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When did you turn it in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The day of the first traceable murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your telephone, Miss Kerr, and ask the
white nurse from Ward B if the pharmacy called
her to check her figures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s off duty now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get her in her room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old nurse hesitated and cringed.</p>
<p>Higgins&rsquo; voice cut her into action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you want to save your own neck ... take
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Miss Kerr hung the receiver back upon
the hook she whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did. She ... read them ... her pencil
memorandum ... on Monday....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins rose steadily and said carefully:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go on as though nothing has happened,
you may get off ... scott free. As soon as I step
from this door, until I return, there will always be
somebody watching you. Is the pharmacy next to
the Administration Building?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her wilted voice responded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. It is off the main corridor ... but I can&rsquo;t
go on! I <i>can&rsquo;t</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood against the closed door and snapped:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<p>&ldquo;Would you rather have a chance to resign ...
or spend the rest of your life in the pen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resign!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not off duty until seven! Understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old pompadour shook carelessly.</p>
<p>Higgins opened the door and started through
the lobby and up the main corridor toward the
pharmacy. His brain was reeling. He was dizzy.</p>
<p>Two Cub Sterlings! God Almighty! Suppose
she was lying? Suppose? ... She was too frightened
to leave, though.... The best thing to do
was sit tight and look over the pharmacy staff.</p>
<p class="tb">When Snod Smooty came back on Ward B, he
found two student nurses on duty and the women
remarkably quiet. They were still subdued by the
grandness of Dr. Cub Sterling&rsquo;s leaving his dying
father to come to see about them. They were excited
over his furrowed face and his sudden ageing. They
didn&rsquo;t call it that, but they felt it, profoundly. To
the funeral-wake-type, death is always as exciting
as birth, and the death of a famous doctor....</p>
<p>Snod tiptoed up to lower a window shade near
Lil Parkins&rsquo; bed. She was sleeping peacefully and
contentedly. The same feeling of admiration which
the other women had experienced for Cub Sterling
had taken the form of protective relaxation in Lil
Parkins. He would see that nothing happened to
her. He had told her to go to sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>An expression of sudden warmth lay over the
colorless features of Snod Smooty as he looked at
Lil. A grand girl, Lil! And a swell detective! Do
anything for a pal. Nursed him through pneumonia
last fall, just because he was her friend....</p>
<p>The day orderly beckoned to him and he went
back to washing dishes. They worked quietly and
with the doors closed. One of the nurses came to
say she was going off the floor a minute.</p>
<p>The day orderly was a squashy fellow who talked
all the time. Snod had known it soon as he set eyes
on him. He finished the saucers and left the man
still talking. His garrulousness had put Snod&rsquo;s
nerves on the jump and he was hungry, too.</p>
<p>Three-thirty and the fool wouldn&rsquo;t leave him
long enough to get even a bottle of cream outa the
ice box! Maybe a cigarette would help....</p>
<p>Snod eased over toward the door and through it.
Halfway up the ward corridor, he caught sight of
chubby Bessie Ellis sitting up in her crib and playing
with a doll ... exactly like the two Dr. MacArthur
had shown them yesterday.</p>
<p>He ran noiselessly to her crib and smiled at her.
They were friends immediately. As he passed the
medicine closet he saw the single student nurse coming
out of the nurses&rsquo; lavatory.</p>
<p>When he smiled at Bessie he took hold of the
foot-board of the crib to steady himself. She was
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
six, and the pink dress of the doll looked pretty
against her brown curls and eyes.</p>
<p>It was the hardest job he had ever tackled. He
said slowly, and his face was innocent and friendly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that new dollie Baby?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Cub jes&rsquo; gave her to me....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod reeled from the bed and staggered toward
that of Lil Parkins. The other women were still
asleep. Some of them were snoring. He leaned over
and peered behind the drawn curtain.</p>
<p>Lil&rsquo;s eyes were wild with fear and her face began
to contract.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop it!&rdquo; Snod&rsquo;s voice was harsh and heavy.
&ldquo;Tell me! You all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She nodded weakly and her intense features began
kaleidoscoping her thoughts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God Almighty! It&rsquo;s Dr. Cub Sterling. I
trapped him ... cold.... He thought I was
asleep and when he leaned over me ... with the
hypodermic....&rdquo; her profile shadow convulsed
against the white pillow, &ldquo;I ... opened ... my
eyes. He had pulled the curtains to ... get
me...!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;You!&rsquo; and started to scream ... and
he drew back and his eyes, Snod. Oh, God ... run
mad, together. Crazy! And then he cocked his left
shoulder, shrugged, lowered his curly head and
bowed himself ... out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s spells, Snod. He wasn&rsquo;t that way this morning.
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
His eyes! I couldn&rsquo;t scream. My heart....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest it, kiddo, till I get Matt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod coiled around and his eyes with the sudden
sharpness of great stress saw the tall figure with the
high shoulder walk out of the linen closet and
enter the elevator.</p>
<p>And then swiftly, noiselessly, and panther-like
he followed.</p>
<p>The elevator door closed just as he reached it.</p>
<p>Three minutes later Snod Smooty slouched up
the main corridor. Nobody was in sight, either way,
except in the distance was a man. The man wore a
white hospital coat, and Snod eyed him hopelessly;
then Snod&rsquo;s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s left shoulder had lifted and from the
left patch pocket there was dangling a frilled pink
organdie doll bonnet!</p>
<p>Snod gathered his muscles and began to
run....</p>
<p>He was almost up with the man when a panicky
woman opened a side door and halted his progress.</p>
<p>She fell into his arms, before he could sidestep
her, and the agony of her face made him involuntarily
support her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Maternity Clinic. Quick! For God&rsquo;s sake,
quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod looked both ways. Only the tall figure was
visible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, hurry!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>He gathered the tortured body of the woman
into his long arms and began running with his back
to the retreating figure.</p>
<p>Nature had tripped him, and he knew it.</p>
<p>When he had helped the orderly inside the door
of the Maternity Clinic, who awaited such emergencies,
to get the panic-stricken woman onto a
handy stretcher, Snod turned swiftly and started
slowly back toward the Administration Building.</p>
<p>MacArthur would know where Matt was. No use
trying to locate him through Miss Kerr.</p>
<p>God in Heaven! Young Sterling! And they had
been so damn near framing three innocent people!
Within that space of a hundred yards, he must
readjust his mind.</p>
<p>His ineffectual thin body shambled innocuously
along....</p>
<p>Behind him there burst upon the air the perfect
trilling of a robin. Snod slid over to a window and
looked stupidly at the grass in the back garden.</p>
<p>Matt Higgins drew alongside and asked loudly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, but could you tell me the
way...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod began pointing through the window at the
different buildings. His eyes followed his fingers.
His voice, once it had formulated an action, was
like a scimiter blade. It shimmered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s MacArthur?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>Higgins was harassed and hot. He was measuring
his forefinger against the left thumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone to train to meet dead nurse&rsquo;s mother.
There are two Cub Sterlings, old Kerr says. Just
confessed. Claims she&rsquo;s seen &rsquo;em. On my way
now....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod&rsquo;s loose hands continued their flappings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kerr&rsquo;s innocent. Two? Jes-sus! One Cub Sterling
just tried to murder Lil. She frightened him
off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins face grayed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-h-a-t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod snapped, &ldquo;I nearly caught him. Had a doll
bonnet hanging from his pocket, walking up this
corridor five minutes ago. Pregnant woman....&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile almost split Matt&rsquo;s lips. Words knocked
it off:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call MacArthur at the station. Have him
get the sheriff to send a warrant immediately. No!
I&rsquo;ll get the kids&rsquo; man. His brother is Attorney-General.
He can act quicker. Then I&rsquo;ll watch Cub
Sterling, until they come. Give me time to think.
Something don&rsquo;t click. I still don&rsquo;t believe it...!
You go to the pharmacy before you go back to
Lil ... over there ... and see if the pharmacist
is in ... if he is watch him until I come....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod&rsquo;s hands continued their waving. But his
eye was out upon the corridor. He hissed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A running man.... Turn around, Matt!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>Matt whirled. Ahead, almost through the door
into the Administration Building, and round the
statue of Elijah Wilson, careened Cub Sterling.</p>
<p>Higgins&rsquo; legs were in motion and his words shot
back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow this one. You watch out for Lil! The
other may try again....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Snod&rsquo;s face remained blank. His biscuit watch
was in his hand. Four doctors were coming up the
corridor. His deferential voice followed Higgins:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have five minutes to make that train, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<h2 id="c10">&raquo;X&laquo;
<br />The Cupola</h2>
<p>As the taxi woggled downhill,
Jumbo&rsquo;s words pushed past the busy clicking of the
meter into Sally&rsquo;s weary brain. Once inside her
consciousness, they rolled around like brightly
colored Christmas tree balls, and butted into each
other and crashed. Far down beneath the shattering
concussions her mind began reverberating:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think it over, think it over, think it over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Twice she decided to go to Bucks and then she
knew it would be hopeless. They couldn&rsquo;t help if a
big story broke. They didn&rsquo;t make the news. They
... they were like buzzards ... and she must
do something to keep them ... from....</p>
<p>Murdering patients.... Oh God! Oh God! ...
No! ... They are wrong!</p>
<p>She pushed her curly bright hair back from her
sweating forehead, and at <i>The Call</i> building gave
the driver the dollar, and slipped unnoticed into a
crowded elevator and out again in the main hallway
of the sixth floor.</p>
<p>This wouldn&rsquo;t do. Somebody might come along.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>She leaned against the wall for a moment, then
decided to walk up to the seventh floor. There was
a vacant suite of offices on the corner; perhaps if
she went where there was plenty of room her brain
would get ... wider....</p>
<p>Half way up the marble stairs began rising and
hitting her in the face, and then slipping back so
that she couldn&rsquo;t quite reach them when she
stepped. She slumped and rested.</p>
<p>If Cub&rsquo;s arms were only around her now. How
many murders had there been? Four! Jumbo had
said four, and the last a nurse. The night he
brought the last cigarettes. She hadn&rsquo;t seen him
since the morning after ... the nurse.... Not
since Dr. Bear began dying ... but she knew!
She knew!</p>
<p>Oh God! God! It wasn&rsquo;t Cub! It wasn&rsquo;t! A murderer
couldn&rsquo;t kiss you so that your soul ran up
and spread out flat under his lips.... A murderer
couldn&rsquo;t look at you so that you said you were
sorry, even when you tried not to be.... A murderer&rsquo;s
hair wouldn&rsquo;t fold into little waves where it
spread under the curve at the back of his neck.</p>
<p>But how could you tell a paper that? How could
you make a city editor understand ... when you
had no proof ... that a man was innocent and
framed?</p>
<p>There must be some way! You had to think
clearly to see it, and the place to think was upstairs
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
with the whole world spread out below in orderly
rows and streets. Just as the sun spread over the
city, and strengthened it, so control made it possible....
Two hours! Less than that now....</p>
<p>She clenched her fists tightly and rose with
studied steadiness. Necessity cleared the brain.
Working in a newspaper office taught that the best
ideas came under pressure. She had gone out on
enough murder stories to know the person who
worked his brain ... could beat anything ...
even newspaper reporters and ... police.</p>
<p>By the time Sally reached the door of the vacant
suite, the seams of her stockings were straightened
and her reddening eyes carefully and painstakingly
dry. There was an air of jauntiness about her
small figure.</p>
<p>She had a head and was going to use it!</p>
<p>Her violet eyes had changed to the deep purple
and iridescent white of orchids. She closed the door
and stood against it. Then her irises focused.</p>
<p>A stooped, intent figure was silhouetted between
the rows of windows and the long city vistas below.
For a second her artistic sense forebade speech.</p>
<p>Like an apple tree, gnarled and buffeted by too
much winter, the thin shoulders, flat chest, beak
nose, and long hands ribboned with purple veins,
strained after the peering eyes which were hidden
by a pair of binoculars. The dirty white hair drawn
into a tightly furled knot, on the upper front of
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
the head, helped Sally recognize the next-to-the-oldest-employe
of <i>The Morning Call</i>. She momentarily
forgot Cub Sterling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emma! What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma wheeled around, and the binoculars fell
from her hands. Sally moved with extended palms
to catch them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s you!&rdquo; Emma&rsquo;s voice was pleased and
birdlike. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t drop, Miss Ferguson. Mr.
Bucks told me you was on vacation. Did you have
a nice time, dearie?&rdquo; She reached toward the long
leather thong which held the binoculars around
her scrawny neck and then embarrassment replaced
pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>are</i> you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I tell you, dearie. Whin I can&rsquo;t git inta
th&rsquo; offices on six ri-away, I jes&rsquo; comes here for a
little while and takes in the city ... kinda. It
helps a lot, sometimes, for bein&rsquo; lonesum, Miss Ferguson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The news-story instinct welled up. Sally eased
down into a window sill. Perhaps, if you shifted the
mind completely....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, dearie, it&rsquo;s like this: My boy ... you
know ... what was killed at the Argonah, had
&rsquo;em.&rdquo; Emma&rsquo;s lower jaw dropped. &ldquo;His buddy
... my boy had got &rsquo;em off&rsquo;n a dead German General,
and you kno&rsquo; what fine things Germans makes
<span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
... well, his buddy took &rsquo;em off&rsquo;n my boy&rsquo;s body
after ... and brought &rsquo;em back to me. And, Miss
Ferguson, he seys whin he give &rsquo;em to me, he seys,
&lsquo;These is t&rsquo;gif ye a chancst t&rsquo;see life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t that sweet, dearie? And they&rsquo;se bin the
greates&rsquo; consterashun thu m&rsquo;sorrow. Whin I gits
t&rsquo;thinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;bout my boy and wishin&rsquo; f&rsquo; gran&rsquo;chillrin
... you kno&rsquo; ... I jes&rsquo; comes up here and takes
in a few lifes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A swell newspaper story! &ldquo;Vicarious living,&rdquo;
Sally muttered.</p>
<p>Emma, heard it and protested:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mam! Nuthin&rsquo; like that! I never looks beyond
Second Street, Miss Ferguson. Two blocks
this side of Beeker Street is an awful nice I-talyan
neighb-hood. It&rsquo;s sweet t&rsquo;see th&rsquo;women nursin&rsquo;
babies on do&rsquo;steps. That&rsquo;s helped me an awful lot
... sometimes....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to take a look, dearie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emma removed the thong from her neck with
the care a concert master saves for his violin. Her
face had now a deep, sweet warmth. Miss Ferguson
had given her five dollars at Easter and at Christmas
and this was a chancst....</p>
<p>Sally saw the look and rose. The folds of her
blue crepe dress molded the curve of her slender
thighs as she lifted the thong carefully over her
head, adroitly around her white cowl collar, and
walked toward the window.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>Emma stood proudly by and suggested:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you look tword the sout&rsquo;wes&rsquo; down by Sears,
Roebuck, you kin&rsquo; jes&rsquo; catch a piece of the bridge
&rsquo;roun&rsquo; th&rsquo;corner buildin&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s awful prutty at sunset.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally, who was something of a football fan, realized
these were eight-power Zeiss binoculars. They
brought the city out with startling clearness. She
looked for the University, and on out toward Sears,
Roebuck and across the river. Then she began
picking out the Italian district near Becker Street
and the Speakeasy just around the corner near
Pershing Road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re wond-er-ful, Emma!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t they gran&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly she remembered about Cub, and
trained the glasses upon the Elijah Wilson four
blocks uphill. Cub was over there ... somewhere....
Cub was....</p>
<p>She began going over the building carefully.
How pink the bricks were in the afternoon sun!
The trees up Wilson Boulevard looked so green
and feathery! How....</p>
<p>Her eyes found the cupola upon the top of the
Administration Building. She had always wanted
to see what was in that cupola! She unscrewed the
lenses to their full power. They came into focus.
One of the grimy windows was open. How lucky!
She trained them into it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>Scissored against the far white wall was Cub
Sterling sitting at a small table. His hand held a
hypodermic syringe. He was laughing....</p>
<p>God Almighty!</p>
<p>Sally staggered as if she had been struck.
Emma, supporting her, soothed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I orta told you, dearie. If you looks too much
you gits dizzy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; her tone was parched and pleading,
&ldquo;look through these at the cupola of the Elijah
Wilson Hospital and tell me what you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old woman took the binoculars, readjusted
them ... it seemed to Sally that she used a thousand
years ... and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shucks, honey, I don&rsquo;t see nuthin&rsquo; but a curly-headed
man settin&rsquo; at a little table writin&rsquo; in a
book.... H&rsquo;m ... he&rsquo;s awful nice lookin&rsquo;!,
too....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally snatched the glasses and spread her feet
to prop herself while she projected them. Her eyes,
as she stiffly moved the dials, were filmy, but within
seconds she had the lenses magnifying the cupola
and as a man might repeat by rote what he knew
by heart, she forced her horror-stricken eyes to
focus again.</p>
<p>What they saw was Cub Sterling sitting at the
same small table, a pen in his hand, writing swiftly
and absorbedly in a small book. Behind him was the
same big red splotch ... as if a bucket of blood
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
had been thrown against the wall ... the same
... small medicine case between two of the sooty
windows.</p>
<p>But before him, upon the table, was the hypodermic
syringe. Her eyes kept coming back to it
over, over and over, as the eyes of a bird fascinated
come back to a snake. And upon his face, as he
wrote, was the awful look which she had never seen
there, until he held that syringe up and laughed.</p>
<p>As she gazed, like an echo in the distance, little
things about him began to be unfamiliar. There
wasn&rsquo;t so much distance under his ear and collar,
where she had buried her nose. And his hair wasn&rsquo;t
that long ... not nearly.... He had just had
his hair cut ... Tuesday....</p>
<p>Maybe that was somebody else.... Maybe....</p>
<p>The glasses began slipping from her hands and
while they fell, with the rapidity of a panic-stricken
brain, she decided.</p>
<p>If it was Cub and she telephoned him and told
him she needed him terribly and to come right away
and he came, then it wasn&rsquo;t Cub. And if he didn&rsquo;t
come, but stayed right there in that chair all the
time....</p>
<p>Well, you had to know ... sometime....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Emma,&rdquo; her voice was crisp and had lost its
note of friendly equality, &ldquo;put those binoculars to
your eyes and watch that man in the top of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
hospital till I come back.... Don&rsquo;t take your
eyes off of him <i>for one second</i>. It&rsquo;s ... it&rsquo;s ...
whether I&rsquo;m ever happy depends on his sitting in
that chair till I come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bent old woman took the glasses, tremblingly,
and Sally was halfway down the hall of the
seventh floor before the cupola was in focus again.</p>
<p>As she ran she debated whether to take a chance
and call from the newspaper office. The open door
of a suite of legal offices flashed by. She wheeled
and entered. None of the stenographers was in the
outer office.</p>
<p>Steadying herself against a typewriter desk she
snatched up the telephone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilson 2000. Hurry, please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had called it two weeks ago for a news story!</p>
<p>In response to the hospital operator&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Lijah-Wilsin,&rdquo;
she said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Ethridge Sterling, Junior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice died away and then came back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Sterling&rsquo;s &rsquo;phone doesn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call him on the loud speaker, please. It&rsquo;s terribly
important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could hear the weary, raucous rasping, which
was penetrating every corridor of the whole hospital:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Docterr Ste-earling. Doct-terr Eth-err-ridge
Ste-earling-Junyior....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every day of the month on the calendar tacked
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
to the far wall hit her in the face ... Monday,
the ninth ... Monday, the sixteenth ... before
she heard Cub&rsquo;s:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Ethridge Sterling, speaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub ... can you come to room 708 in <i>The
Call</i> building, right away...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? ... Salscie...? Where are you?
How did you...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A terrible calm invaded her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, Cub! I walked out of the hospital. I
had to...! Something awful...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the rising concern of his voice seemed
to be put on, and then his, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t leave Father.
He&rsquo;s....&rdquo;</p>
<p>She braced herself for a final effort and begged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But I&rsquo;m in <i>terrible</i> ... I need you,
darling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Salscie....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Room 708, Cub! ...&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw the telephone from her and reeled into
the hall and toward the vacant suite. Her eyes were
right! Cub was not coming. Cub was ... was....</p>
<p>With a listlessness which portrayed great physical
effort, she pushed the door open and looked
toward the stooped back of Emma; then she swayed
steadily toward a low Window sill and sat down. Her
eyes were the color of clouds before a thunder storm
and she leaned her head against the casing.</p>
<p>Then with that funny clearness which is always
<span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
part of terror, she began to count the carpet tacks
on both sides of two planks in the floor. One, two
... his voice was foggy and distant ... six,
seven, eight ... he was irritated.... &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
come. I can&rsquo;t come!&rdquo;... Cub Sterling was a
murderer ... a maniac....</p>
<p>As the thought began forming in her mind she
revolted, and the revolt brought energy. Within
half a minute after entering the room, she was at
Emma&rsquo;s side, begging:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t move, did he? He didn&rsquo;t move,
Emma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I seen, but twicest I sneezed and los&rsquo;
him, Miss Ferguson. But whin I got him back in,
agin, he was settin&rsquo; jes th&rsquo; same and writin&rsquo; away
... liken he is....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally grabbed the binoculars and twisted them
painstakingly as she placed the strap over her head.
If he hadn&rsquo;t moved, then perhaps ... but he
might have heard the loud Speaker and gone to a
&rsquo;phone while Emma was sneezing ... would the
loud speaker penetrate into that cupola...?</p>
<p>When she focused the figure again she began
scrutinizing it. He had turned. Only his back and
high shoulder ... but the distance from his ear
to his collar wasn&rsquo;t wasn&rsquo;t....</p>
<p>Nobody but Cub had shoulders like that! Nobody
except Cub sat that way....</p>
<p>There was only one Cub Sterling in the world
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
and in spite of every little thing which wasn&rsquo;t right
this was he. And if he sat in that chair another ten
minutes she would never walk and talk again ...
and if he didn&rsquo;t sit there but came to her....</p>
<p>She staggered back at that thought and Emma
ran to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t git yourself so excited, dearie. What&rsquo;s
that big-headed man to you? He ain&rsquo;t nuthin&rsquo; but
a doctor&rsquo;s helper, doin&rsquo; his regular....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally kept the glasses carefully focused and
said, quite calmly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever seen him before, Emma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as I kin recklek. But thin I ain&rsquo;t no jedge.
I ain&rsquo;t no crazier &rsquo;bout lookin&rsquo; at hossbittles thin
I is &rsquo;bout bein&rsquo; in thim, Miss Ferguson. I tell you
lots of my frin&rsquo;s done gone up to thet hossbittle and
ain&rsquo;t never bin heard frum since. Ef a body&rsquo;s goin&rsquo;
to die, he&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; die, hossbittle or no hossbittle, I
says. Look at my boy en the Argonah! I recklek
whin he got hurt in a football scrimpage, over at
Western High and they tried to take him to....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her chatter, like water in a distant bathtub during
a bad dream, splashed past Sally&rsquo;s brain. Then
it ceased to register, for the man at the table had
risen and was opening a drawer in the medicine cabinet.</p>
<p>And hope sprang suddenly high in Sally&rsquo;s
heart. His shoulders squared and were flat! Cub
stooped....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<p>But the shape of the head and the way the hair
curled at the back of the neck sickened her, horribly.
It was only when he reached in a hip pocket
and drew out a handkerchief ... Cub carried his
in his white coat breast pocket....</p>
<p>Then he reached back toward the table for the
hypodermic syringe, and held it up to the light
again.... And his left shoulder rose ... and
Sally Ferguson&rsquo;s eyes floated hopelessly, the stiff
tensity of her body began to relax ... she staggered
forward....</p>
<p>Coming up the hall was the sound of running
feet and they sounded like the feet of running
men....</p>
<p>The door swung open. The note of relief in Cub
Sterling&rsquo;s voice as he said &ldquo;Salscie!&rdquo; stiffened her
relaxing muscles and gave her the power to turn.</p>
<p>Matthew Higgins had come out of the Administration
Building as the long, lank body of Cub
Sterling shot into a taxi at the stand.</p>
<p>Higgins had jumped another cab.</p>
<p>Sally Ferguson turned and swayed toward Sterling
as Matthew Higgins stepped inside the door
and it was he who caught the incredulity, the anguish,
the blind hope of her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub! Are you <i>really</i> Cub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Sterling reached her his voice was stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it? You <i>must</i> tell me,&rdquo; his eyes cut into
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
her clouding ones and Matthew Higgins stepped
alongside and said curtly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poison her too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally Ferguson&rsquo;s lids began lowering and she
gasped, holding up the glasses with her ebbing
strength:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look, Cub! The cu-po-la!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words faded with her closing eyes, and the
final horror in them made Cub Sterling lay her
head against his chest, place his long arms under
her breasts and raise the binoculars, which were
still suspended around her neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lan&rsquo; sakes. It&rsquo;s only a man. Jes, a doctor&rsquo;s
helper. And I seys....&rdquo; Emma had found her
voice at last, but Cub Sterling cut in:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God Almighty! Look! And tell me what
you....&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words were directed toward Emma.</p>
<p>Matthew Higgins took the glasses from Cub&rsquo;s
hands and Sally&rsquo;s neck before Cub said, &ldquo;Tell
me....&rdquo; The expression on his face had convinced
Higgins that he saw ... something ...
vile.</p>
<p>A silence, like the high hysteria after a buoy-bell,
spread over the waiting doctor. His eyes, livid
with fear, turned upon the florid, gray figure of
Matthew Higgins. And it was Higgins&rsquo; voice that
brought Sally Ferguson out of her purple palaces.
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
Its steadiness was more hysterical than any word
that had been uttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man with his head turned away from me ...
sitting at a small table writing in a book, his left
shoulder is ... he is reaching for a hypodermic
syringe and holding it up and.... The murderer! ...
The murderer! The crazy doctor!
The other Cub Sterling!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glasses hit the floor with a thud and Matthew
Higgins started down the hallway before Cub
Sterling and Sally Ferguson turned around. He
must reach Snod ... reach Snod. In the same
legal offices from which Sally had telephoned he
grabbed the receiver and ordered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elijah Wilson Hospital, immediately!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Number? Number? Number?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me. I don&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally reached the doorway and sighed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilson 2000.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the connection was through Higgins
rasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Henry MacArthur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The nasal whine of the placid operator came
back:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. MacArthur&rsquo;s &rsquo;phone doesn&rsquo;t answer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then give me Ward B, Medicine Clinic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never connect &lsquo;outside&rsquo; with the wards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hell with you!&rdquo; Higgins threw the &rsquo;phone
from him and followed the running figure of Cub
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
Sterling toward the elevator shaft. Sally Ferguson
eased in as the door slipped to, and said to the operator:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will, non-stop one. For God&rsquo;s sake, quick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins&rsquo; head cleared. &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; Cub nodded
vacantly.</p>
<p>As they ran from the building Cub Sterling
jumped in beside the driver of a cruising taxi and
ordered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elijah Wilson. To hell with traffic lights! Five
dollars if you do it in two minutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt Higgins pulled Sally Ferguson into the
back seat and slammed the door.</p>
<p>They began their wild, uphill snaking in and
out.</p>
<p>Matt Higgins said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we are not there in seconds, that devil will
be.... Who is it, Sterling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub took his panic-stricken eyes from the approaching
hospital and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Mr. Immer....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Higgins. Hired by Dr. MacArthur to ... a
New York dick, doc.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oh&rdquo; was spontaneous.</p>
<p>Higgins turned and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it took a lady...!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cab drew up at the hospital. Cub Sterling
was out and up the steps before the driver applied
the brakes. Matt Higgins tossed him the money
<span class="pb" id="Page_308">308</span>
and he and Sally caught Cub before he was halfway
up the main staircase in the Administration Building.
They reached the second floor and ran around
the octagonal railing, through which Sally caught
a glimpse of the statue of Elijah Wilson, far below,
and on to the third floor. There Cub turned,
wild eyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which way?&rdquo; Higgins demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.... I&rsquo;ve never been....&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins began systematically opening doors
and looking for an outlet. Little streams of late
afternoon sun filtered through the cracks. The hospital
was deathly still. All of the people off duty
were preparing to go to Rose Standish&rsquo;s funeral.</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s hands continued wringing themselves,
and she begged:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cub, isn&rsquo;t there some way ... another stairs,
Cub?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swirled without a word and ran down to the
second floor again. Higgins and Sally followed,
hopefully.</p>
<p>Another stairs ... behind the pharmacy ...
where Rose Standish had kissed his interne ...
perhaps that went up as well as down....</p>
<p>They reached the door that opened onto the enclosed
stairway. Cub pulled the knob savagely.
The door flew open. He peered into the darkness.
Matthew Higgins thick body brushed him aside.
<span class="pb" id="Page_309">309</span>
The detective pushed onto the narrow landing and
struck a match. Caticornered from the stairway
that led down to the pharmacy, a rusty door-knob
caught the reflection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Locked!&rdquo; his discovery was like a curse.</p>
<p>Sally stood in the doorway that led to the second
floor and moaned. Fatigue. Blinding fatigue was
beginning to....</p>
<p>Cub Sterling moved over to Higgins&rsquo; side and
said &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s bust it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They propped their feet upon the opposite wall
and laid their shoulders against the flimsy panels.
The match was out and the veins in their necks
began choking them.</p>
<p>Far down below Sally heard the clanking bell of
an approaching ambulance; it hid the scrunching
of the wood from her ears.</p>
<p>She stepped onto the landing and tried to see.
Before her eyes were accustomed to the dark, the
heavy breathing of the two men seeped into her like
a narcotic. She lay weakly against the wall.</p>
<p>The breathing had ceased for half a second before
she opened her eyes. Through the final screech
of the bulging door she heard Higgins&rsquo; voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Footprints!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He and Cub were through the hole and halfway
up the narrow, winding stairway. She could see
Higgins&rsquo; match ahead as she scrambled through the
jagged panelling.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>The steps were high and horrible. She lost all
light when Higgins rounded the turn. When she
staggered up, again, Higgins had his hand upon a
knob and was ordering, in the heavy darkness:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand over there, Sterling!&rdquo; and then, &ldquo;It opens
out and is....&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned the knob, and a rush of yellow sunlight
filled the twisting stairs. They pushed on into
it. The last three steps extended past the cupola
door and into the octagonal room.</p>
<p>Higgins, Cub and Sally stood upon these steps
and looked.</p>
<p>Their gray, brown and violet eyes mirrored beside
the white medicine case, a raised glass in hand,
the counterpart of Cub Sterling ... gone insane.</p>
<p>The late afternoon sun played upon the bushy
hair, upon the similar, yet dissimilar faces. It
caught each feature, as it catches mountain crags
and emphasized it. The same white coat, the same
carriage, but not the same eyes.</p>
<p>It was the eyes which froze all three spectators
into a paralyzed horror. They were the color of Cub
Sterling&rsquo;s, except that they centered upon his own
eyes with a blistering, venomous, consuming hate,
and that hate was confirmed in the crooked, violent
twist of the almost rigid lips.</p>
<p>The lips opened, the man gave his left shoulder
the hysterical twist and drained the glass, but even
with his head thrown back, his eyes bored into and
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
scorched the brain of Cub Sterling, and held Matthew
Higgins inert with horror.</p>
<p>It was Sally&rsquo;s, &ldquo;Peaches! I smell peaches!&rdquo; that
brushed past their fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cyanide!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Cub barked the word, the tall man stiffened
gauntly, his eyes still intent upon Sterling&rsquo;s; then
his body, like a palm tree in a hurricane, cracked
suddenly forward.</p>
<p>The medicine cabinet was within ten feet of the
steps upon which Higgins, Cub and Sally stood,
and the man fell so that his head just brushed the
railing. His hands automatically spread through
the railing and caught Sterling&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>The fall threw his hair forward and Matthew
Higgins snapped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s eyes began disentangling themselves from the
glassy vileness of the dead man&rsquo;s stare. Matthew
Higgins reached down and savagely yanked
at the stiffening hands around Cub&rsquo;s knees.</p>
<p>Sterling, his own hands gripping the railing for
support, endeavored vainly to make his reeling
mind bring his tortured eyes into focus.</p>
<p>Matthew Higgins threw the dead man&rsquo;s hand
heavily back upon the floor; the body rolled half
over.</p>
<p>Higgins rasped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor who?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>Cub&rsquo;s brain snapped. His eyes focused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God! Baldy! It&rsquo;s Baldy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He lay upon the railing and carefully repeated in
a dead monotone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baldy Rath ... bone ... Baldy....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sentence did not cut through and Higgins
bellowed into Cub&rsquo;s ear:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Rathbone ... who&rsquo;s he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It reached. Cub stood straight and clipped:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Baldy Rathbone. Not doctor. Chief pharmacist
of the Elijah Wilson. But why in God&rsquo;s name!
Baldy Rathbone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The incredulity returned. He looked again at
the inert body with its eerie features.</p>
<p>Higgins nodded slowly....</p>
<p>The long hair had flopped so that the wide part
again led to the shiny spot....</p>
<p>&ldquo;The book!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the sentence finally reached Sally&rsquo;s lips,
it whipped both Sterling and Higgins into action.
They ran across the room and the sun took their
gray and brown heads and played upon them.
Through the cob-webbed windows it shone with
prismatic beauty onto the now expressionless face
of the dead man.</p>
<p>A terrible desire to get away from that hideous
beauty gave Sally the will to mount the remaining
steps and run to the table and to Cub.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>Through the single open window, the late spring
breeze played gently. It brought a hush to the horror-stricken
air and a single fly entered, flew directly
to the dead man&rsquo;s face and began walking
upon his crooked lips, up his relaxed cheek and
around his glassy eyes.</p>
<p>Matthew Higgins held, in his blunt hairy hand,
a small stiff-backed notebook, such as the Elijah
Wilson used for ward-addresses. The back was
checkered and the pages ruled. It was open at a
half-written page. The ink was still wet and the
small, finely formed script stood out heavily.</p>
<p>Cub read over his shoulder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cupola.... May 19th, 3:55 P. M. I have
just failed to administer to the patient in Bed
11, Ward B, Medicine Clinic, a hypodermic of
coniine. She opened her eyes suddenly and recognized
me as ... Cub Sterling! Nothing
could be more fortunate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beforehand I presented to Bessie Ellis my
usual token. I was followed by an orderly whom
I suspect as a detective. I got away ... but at
last ... at last ... my brother may be arrested....
It has worked, perfectly!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My God! Lil!&rdquo; Higgins said savagely as he
dropped the book onto the plain deal table.</p>
<p>Nobody paid him any attention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<p>Cub Sterling said, &ldquo;&lsquo;My brother?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Sally Ferguson picked up the book and
began reading aloud from the first page. Her voice
was thin and pointed and she read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;In 1883 there came to Heidelberg as a medical
student a young American named Ethridge
Sterling. He had studied at the Hotel Dieu and
in New York. He lived at the Eagle Inn and attended
lectures in surgery under Klotz.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a chambermaid at the Eagle Inn, there
was a young Bavarian girl, Gretchen Seinrich.
She was fair to gaze upon and full of country
spirits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cub Sterling had sat down, his head buried in
his cupped hands. Matthew Higgins rested against
a corner of the table. He was suddenly old. Lil Parkins
... for many years....</p>
<p>They both listened, vacant of expression, and at
the same time horrified with interest, to Sally&rsquo;s
voice:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;From the spring of 1883 to the fall of 1884
young Sterling prevailed upon Gretchen Seinrich
to live with him and she did so. I like to believe
they were in love. I know she always was
in love with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In October 1884, Sterling was suddenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
called back to New York by the unexpected
death of his father. He promised to write. He
never did so. He promised to send his address.
He did not do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last night he spent in Heidelberg he
spent with her. While she was still asleep he
arose and wrote the note containing all of the
above promises, and before she woke he had
packed and gone....</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I was conceived....</p>
<p>&ldquo;She returned to Bavaria and went to work
as a seamstress. After my birth, my mother determined
to come to America and find my father
... and so she went to work at a more profitable
profession ... the oldest.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The utter and terrible stillness of Cub Sterling
was more frightful than any words would have
been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; Matthew Higgins was relentless and
Sally continued.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;It took three years to earn enough money to
come to America and then it took years of blind
wandering to reach this hospital and....</p>
<p>&ldquo;When she reached it, her great love had
grown, through endless pain and privation, to a
great bitterness. She determined to reveal the
Great Dr. Sterling and ruin him, and by mistake
<span class="pb" id="Page_316">316</span>
when she asked to see him, she was taken,
instead, to his father-in-law, Dr. Jemison, and
it was through the door of Dr. Jemison&rsquo;s office
that she saw Ethridge Sterling standing with
his arm around Dr. Jemison&rsquo;s daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had a heart attack. Dr. Jemison pronounced
her dead, and she was carted back
through the dispensary door and handed over
to a German Society for burial. The president
of the society was Otto Weber. He burned her
papers and I, then nine, was put into an orphan
asylum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father was already famous. He was Otto&rsquo;s
best customer. But what we learn in the first
eight years of our lives ... if it is bitter ...
we never forget....</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the asylum we had candy at Christmas
and mush for breakfast, and the Elijah Wilson
operated upon us, free, when necessary. I remember
quite vividly when I was operated upon.
Double hernia, and endless pain, and a dispensary
consultation. Dr. Sterling was designated
to do the operation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon the day slated, his son was born and
my case was turned over to an assistant resident.
A man killed in the War....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fegus,&rdquo; Cub&rsquo;s voice was low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The doctor had never done the operation before.
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
I was his first ... the incisions were too
deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost my mother before I really knew her and
my manhood before it began....</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lost both of them because my father was
Dr. Ethridge Sterling, of the famous hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At sixteen, when the boys in the orphanage
discovered my inabilities, I determined to ruin
my father ... and began studying pharmacy
with an idea of becoming connected, eventually,
with his hospital.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The orphanage farmed me out to a pharmacist.
Otto Weber had become a political influence.
I went to him and worked upon his sentiment.
It was he, and the excellency of my work
... and why not? I am the son of Dr. Sterling
... that persuaded the Attorney-General
to recommend me to Dr. Barton and Dr. MacArthur
as assistant pharmacist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed my state boards brilliantly. I entered
the pharmacy of the Elijah Wilson, the
same year that Cub Sterling entered medical
school.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He spent ten years studying the science of
medicine. I spent those ten years perfecting
myself in the science of murder. At first I intended
murdering the patients of my father,
slowly, occasionally, over a period of years.
Then I perceived if I waited until Wilkins died,
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
became promoted as Chief Pharmacist and
murdered my brother&rsquo;s patients, I would doubly
ruin my father....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the gods smiled...! Through the
losing of my top hair, I, unconsciously, grew a
nickname. For five years now, I have catered to
that nickname. I shaved my center part to accentuate
my bald spot. I pomaded my long front
hair, which naturally is curly as my brother&rsquo;s,
to slick behind my ears ... to change my forehead
line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not a famous doctor around this
hospital who would not testify as to my baldness....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Around a hospital where so many people are
constantly passing at stated intervals to stated
places, the eyes of even a good observer become
dulled into &lsquo;seeing,&rsquo; when a person resembling
a familiar doctor passes at an unexpected time,
that doctor!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is upon that knowledge, a sudden assumption
of my brother&rsquo;s queer angularity, and the
combing of my recently washed hair to cover my
bald spot, that I have built my resemblance ...
not upon the features....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day I shall be caught. When I am
caught my father will be caught also.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all?&rdquo; Higgins was still relentless....</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>Cub Sterling&rsquo;s head jerked up from his folded
arms and he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;God! It&rsquo;s enough!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sally Ferguson&rsquo;s voice out into him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a diary of the murders, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men rose and came to her side. Their movement
disturbed the fly and he began circling around
the dead man&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Sally&rsquo;s voice drowned out his buzzing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cupola, Friday, May 13th ... 1:00 A.M.
I have just committed my first murder upon the
patient in Bed 11, Ward B. I know I have just
completed it, because I filled, myself, the prescription
to which I added Datura stramonium.
The medicine was to be administered at midnight.
The dose should, with the heavy bromide
I included, have acted in an hour. It is unexpected
and therefore not likely to cause an autopsy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The patient is one of my father&rsquo;s and also
under the care of my brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she is now dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Cupola, Sunday, May 15th ... 1:00 A.M.
The murder of the second patient in Bed 11,
Ward B, is now completed. I tripled the prescription
dose of Digitalis. It was to be administered
at 12 M.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is a patient of my brother and observed
by my father. Though autopsy is performed the
condition of the organs will be such as not to
suggest chemical analysis. Therefore I am protected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far suspicion is not aroused, but patience
is not a virtue in which I have been lacking. It
takes time to make a reputation and time ...
to ... my candle is almost gone....&rdquo;</p>
<p class="tb">&ldquo;Cupola, Tuesday, May 17th ... 1:15
A. M. I have just returned from Ward B where
by the use of coniine administered with a hypodermic
syringe, I have murdered the patient in
Bed 11. My first traceable murder. Peters and
Paton nearly caught me. If murdering ugly
women is so much pleasure; a pretty woman....
Tonight I began an intriguing custom. I
left upon the crib of Bessie Ellis a Ma-ma doll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Kerr was on the ward at the time. She
is stealing morphia again. So ... even should
she have recognized me, she will deny all knowledge.
Most fortunate!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The staff meeting yesterday, at which my
brother escaped all censure, forces me into action.
This autopsy will reveal murder and begin,
I hope, the suspicion. My plan is working splendidly!
But why not? Fifteen years&rsquo; patient study
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
are behind it. I am tired and it is late.... Seeing
Peters and Paton was luck....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;My eyes ... I can&rsquo;t....&rdquo; Sally wailed.</p>
<p>Matthew Higgins took the book from her hands;
the fading light was eerie. Cub Sterling put his
arms around the girl and drew her into his lap.
She began to shiver and Higgins read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cupola, Wednesday, May 18th ... 1:30
A.M. The Gods are on my side. I have just
murdered Rose Standish. She was a pretty
woman, and my father had ordered a sleeping
potion ... then he came by and asked me privately
to make it bread pills. I did ... plus
an African sleeping drug. Ah! the murder
drugs are so fascinating and Heddis searched
for the obvious potions, only.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, luck! Ah, irony! Bear Sterling helping
his illegitimate son to ruin his legitimate one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rose Standish was asleep by midnight. The
student nurse nearly caught me. It was exciting!
She will testify against my brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yesterday I was called before the staff to
check drugs after Heddis settled upon coniine.
It is all so damnably easy. Of course no house
sold the supply. I made it from the hemlock I
gathered in the mountains of Pennsylvania
when I was east on vacation. I had thought so
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
long about what to use. Something which we did
not keep in the pharmacy. I used to think something
untraceable ... and then when I met
Heddis I saw he would discover....</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then coniine came to me. Out of a volume
of Plato I found in a pullman seat in the Broad
Street Station coniine came to me. Coniine, such
a word! Coniine!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The suspicion is growing. My brother and
my father are panicky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put another doll upon Bessie&rsquo;s crib. I
passed no one in the corridor. Rose Standish was
a pretty woman....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Crazy. Dead crazy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins&rsquo; nerves were jumpy too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else?&rdquo; Cub&rsquo;s voice had become relentless,
now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cupola, Wednesday, May 18th, Noon. My
father has pneumonia and will die without the
knowledge of my brother&rsquo;s ruination unless I act
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a daylight murder within the
next twenty-four hours. If there is no patient
in Bed 11, then upon the patient in a corresponding
bed upon another floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<p>&ldquo;Before he dies, my brother must be under
arrest....</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take careful planning to execute a
daylight murder ... but years of careful
planning prepare one....&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;God! It makes me sick to read it! Lil Parkins,
the best woman....&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A detective you put in the bed...?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins nodded flatly, and turned the pages. At
the back of the book was written, upon the stiff
cover:</p>
<p class="center"><i>Murder Chart</i>:</p>
<dl class="undent"><dt>May 13th, 1:00 A. M.&mdash;goitre&mdash;E.S. &amp; E.S. Jr.&mdash;Datura stramonium</dt>
<dt>May 15th, 1:00 A. M.&mdash;heart&mdash;E.S. &amp; E.S. Jr.&mdash;overdose Digitalis</dt>
<dt>May 17th, 1:15 A. M.&mdash;operative E.S. obs. S. Jr.&mdash;Coniine</dt>
<dt>May 18th, 1:30 A. M.&mdash;nurse&mdash;E.S. Jr. obs. E.S.&mdash;Coniine</dt>
<dt>May 19th, 3:40 P. M.&mdash;heart&mdash;House &amp; E.S. Jr.&mdash;failed to murder but ruined E.S. Jr.</dt></dl>
<p>The sunset breeze wound in the window and
loosened the bands of Higgins&rsquo; heated brain, and
the hysterical tears of Sally Ferguson. She buried
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
her head in Cub&rsquo;s shoulder and sobbed horribly.</p>
<p>Her sobs were long and rending and they forced
Matthew Higgins into instant action. He struck a
match, tore the pages from the front of the blank
book and put them over the match.</p>
<p>The yellow-red flames ran up the crinkling
paper as Cub Sterling&rsquo;s legs began untangling
themselves and he threw Sally aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aw, what&rsquo;s the use?&rdquo; Higgins&rsquo; gray eyes shot
into Cub. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead and your father&rsquo;s dying. The
body and the murder chart&rsquo;s all we need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The contact with Cub had revived Sally&rsquo;s fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can we stop <i>The Call</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Higgins snapped around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who owns it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cub was half across the room toward Sally. He
swerved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Barton told me half an hour ago that the Attorney-General
had just bought it.... Now I
see....&rdquo; His voice shattered.</p>
<p>Sally ran toward him. Higgins pushed a chair
under his bending legs.</p>
<p>The fly rose from the dead man&rsquo;s face and slipped
with the curling smoke out of the open window
toward the distant river.</p>

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
